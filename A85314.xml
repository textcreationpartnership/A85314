            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

<pb facs="tcp:117994:4"/>to heare them, who were the firſt inſtruments of their good (if they have any, as ſome we hope have) and yet the Miniſters are the ſame they were before; yea, ſome repenting, that ever they beſtowed ſo much paines and time to follow the Miniſter, as one that lives but foure or five miles from <hi>Dedham</hi> hath ſaid, He repented that he followed that eminent Servant of God, Mr. <hi>Rogers</hi> ſo much, to heare his prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching. While I obſerved theſe things, and conſidered into what a ſad condition we are fallen, and read over your <hi>Vindication,</hi> in which I ſaw a holy, meeke, and true Chriſtian ſpirit breathing, calling upon the Congregationall men to joyne with you; certainly I thought that Booke deſerved a courteous Chriſtian anſwer from the ableſt of our Congregationall men: what they have done towards it I know not, (being little acquainted with affaires abroad, being locked up in much ſadneſſe of ſpirit at home) but I thought with my ſelfe, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I was numbred among the Independents (though I am the weakeſt, and moſt worthy the holy Lord ſhould turne me out of his holy Work) laying other things together (which I have mentioned in the Epiſtle to the Reader) I reſolved to improve the little Talent the Lord had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven me, in examining the grounds of theſe practices, and to ſtand up in the defence of ſuch Miniſters, who I ſaw were deare to Chriſt, and whom in holineſſe, learning, and abilities, the Lord had honoured farre before my ſelfe.

I have obſerved few people that come once to ſtand up for Independency, but they grow very tender (as they call it) towards corrupt Opinions, if not leavened with them themſelves, not allowing a Miniſter to ſpeake againſt them; yea, and thoſe, whom I tooke to be the ſobereſt and beſt grounded Chriſtians, have not ſtuck to Cenſure <hi>New England</hi> ſharply, for being too ſtrict againſt thoſe which they call, Non-fundamentall Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors;

For your parts (my Fathers) you and the godly Presbyterians of <hi>England,</hi> are eſteemed the cauſes of all theſe troubles; yea, I obſerve by Letters, which my ſelfe and others have received from the Divines of <hi>New England,</hi> that ſome have informed them, as if you were the cauſes of the ſecond Warre, when Duke <hi>Hamilton,</hi> and Lord <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,</hi> &amp;c. aroſe. Alſo that you are ſo adverſe to the Congregationall Churches here, that you had rather joyne with the Common Enemy, and hazzard your owne Liberties, then enjoy your Liberties with your Brethren, the Congregationall men; but you have I thinke ſufficiently cleared your ſelves from theſe aſperſions in your <hi>Vindication,</hi> yea, and ſo can the Congregationall men cleare you, I beleeve; there is one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port that goes for truth, and that amongſt perſons of note, and upon that ground I perceive, I meane ſome men here, they much ſatisfie themſelves in this ſcorne caſt upon you, viz. That the Aſſembly of Divines, when things were likely to ſettle on the Presbyterian ſide, ſhould determine, <hi>That Congregationall Miniſters ſhould not be allowed any publicke place to preach in, nor ſhould be allowed any publick maintenance.</hi> This is certainly beleeved by men of note, I wiſh the truth were cleared; I am not ignorant what provocation it was, to have your people taken from you, &amp;c. but yet I can hardly beleeve the Aſſembly to be ſo hard to their Brethren.</p>
            <p>Further (but that I am too meane to move, and know not whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther my motion be good or no in your thoughts) I could heartily wiſh, you would pleaſe to declare,
<note place="margin">Pag. 119, 120, 121.</note> how farre you could yeeld to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregationall Brethren: you have hinted ſome things in your Vindication, which imply much; but if it were thought meet to ſpeake out a little more fully, then ſhould our <hi>New England</hi> Divines clearly underſtand where the greateſt cauſe of this diſ-union lyes, againſt all falſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports that are ſent to them.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:117994:5"/>to the contrary (fearing my weakneſſe) to dedicate this Treatiſe to you, it being the greateſt deſire of my heart to ſee the Kingdome of Chriſt, firſt exalted in my owne wretched heart, and then to ſee Claſsicall, and Congregationall men joyning together, with one ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to ſet up his viſible Kingdome in <hi>England,</hi> oppoſing Errour and Schiſme, and Chriſt riding in Triumph upon his white Horſe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering ſoules by his poore Inſtruments, that once it may be ſaid of England, <hi>The Lord bleſſe thee, O habitation of Juſtice, and moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of Holineſſe.</hi>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Shall briefly give you an account what moved me to undertake this taske: <hi>1.</hi> I obſerved it very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon among Chriſtians, when we have beene ſpeaking about ſome Miniſter, godly, eminent, &amp;c. againſt whom no objection can be made; but if he were a man of the Presbyterial judgement, they would make ſleight ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of him. <hi>Hee? He is a Presbyterian,</hi> and if you have ſaid ſo, <hi>Presbyterian</hi> is crime enough; hence to ſeparate from a Presbyterial Miniſter, though never ſo able and godly, they thinke it no offence at all; this made me ſearch what they had to ſay againſt theſe Presbyterial men, whether their grounds for ſuch contempt were ſolid, as alſo for their ſeparation.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2.</hi> I received two Letters from <hi>New England</hi> from a worthy Divine, one ſome longer time ſince, the other but lately, in which there were theſe paſſages: In the firſt, which was writ after the overthrow of <hi>Duke Hamilton</hi> he hath this paſſage, <hi>We doe not know what to pray for in your behalfe: God hath removed adverſaries, fought miraculouſly for you againſt the</hi> Scots, <hi>and put the power of things into ſuch hands, as have beene moſt active for the godly party, and yet your condition is as miſerable as ever, the Lord helpe, for vaine is the helpe of man: I much feare, you that are the godly Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, have beene too paſſive, and not ſo zealous againſt Errours and Hereſies, as you ought, and therefore it is juſt with the Lord, to let in theſe inundations of helliſh opinions upon you, which damp all power of Religion, whereſoever they become;</hi> though I am not worthy to be reckoned among the godly Miniſters, yet my conſcience doth not accuſe me of this fault, I am rather judged a man too ſevere. In his other Letter, which came at the end of this Summer, he wrote thus:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It's the wonderment of this ſide of the world, that you that are
<pb facs="tcp:117994:6"/>godly, and may agree, yet will not.</hi> Neither doth my conſcience ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe me in this point, I hope I ſhall cleare it by the enſuing Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>3.</hi> Among the many crimes charged upon the Independent Churches, I have noted theſe two eſpecially; <hi>1.</hi> That they are but a backe doore for Errours and Hereſies. <hi>2.</hi> That they regard no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but their owne intereſt, ſo long as they have their liberty, though there are Miniſters as godly, able, and learned, and many hundreds of true viſible Churches in the Nation beſides theirs, yet they regard not them, nor their comfort; being therefore ſet downe by Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> in his Catalogue of Independents, I thought I would cleare my ſelfe of all theſe things, and though I be but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the meaneſt, and not worth the regarding, yet to diſcharge my ſelfe, and to have my ſpirit free, when ever God ſhall viſit us for theſe Diviſions, Errours, Hereſies, &amp;c. [for what can we expect but ſome rod, if we continue in the frame we now are in?] I have made bold humbly to addreſſe my ſelfe to our Congregational Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, to be ſeech them, to take thoſe offers, which the Presbyteriall brethren make for agreement, that ſo we may ſtrengthen one another againſt the common adverſaries, that trouble our Reformation.</p>
            <p>I thought to have taken occaſion here to cleare my ſelfe from what Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> had writ concerning me, but the man being dead, I rather let it alone, (for ſin, I thanke God, he hath charged me with none) I know, if ever the Lord bring ſuch an unworthy wretch as I am to heaven, I ſhall not beare Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> a grudge for what unkindneſſe he hath offered to me here. But whereas Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> hath branded me for an Independent; ſome of (miſerable) <hi>Colcheſter</hi> have told me that I have altered my principles; but I know no reaſon why the one ſhould charge me to be an Independent, nor the other for departing from my principles; for I never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared any thing in publike, but onely once, which was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the matter and forme of a viſible Church: for the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church never troubled me, but how to have the people reformed, and ſcandalous perſons debarred from the ſeales of the Covenant, and perſons brought into a poſture fit for Diſcipline, but what is this to Independency? Once alſo I expreſſed this, that I conceived, <hi>a Church organized, and walking regularly might execute all the power of the Keyes within it ſelf.</hi> I never expreſſed any thing more there concerning Church-worke, but did labour to keep alive the old truths, which I found my heart had more need of, then to
<pb facs="tcp:117994:6"/>preach about Church-government in ſuch a Towne, as that was. But if you ſay, though I did not expreſſe it openly, yet I was an Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent in my judgement: but how can men charge me with that, whi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>c neither in publike, nor private they ever heard me ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe? but then to deale plainly I ſhall ſet down what manner of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent then I was, and then you ſhall ſee how much I am altered. In theſe points I did joyne with the Congregational-men.</p>
            <p>Firſt, I thought none but viſible Saints to be fit matter for a Church.</p>
            <p>Secondly,
<note place="margin">So the Belgick Churches.</note> I thought a promiſe from the people to ſubject them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to Church-diſcipline was of very great concernment, to carry on Diſcipline with ſtrength and comfort, as likewiſe to ſubject them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to all other Ordinances, as became Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, though I did owne the Churches of <hi>England</hi> for true Churches, yet becauſe for want of <hi>Catechiſing</hi> and <hi>Diſcipline,</hi> they were overgrowne with <hi>ignorance</hi> and <hi>prophaneneſſe:</hi> I did deſire the groſly ignorant and prophane to ſtay a while, before I gave t heir children the ſeale of Baptiſme, that having got knowledge, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation freed from ſcandall, the Ordinance might be adminiſtred with more comfort.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, I thought that if Churches were now conſtituting, the Officers ſhould not receive any into Church-fellowſhip againſt the conſent of the people, giving ſufficient proofe againſt them.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, I thought the Officers ought not excommunicate any perſon, If the people did not conſent to them [not that a Church muſt be obſtructed, if two or three have a minde to be croſſe.]</p>
            <p>Sixtly, I thought a particular Church organized to be the <hi>firſt ſubject</hi> of the power of the Keyes, and according as Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> held it out: but this I did not expreſſe publikely.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, I did ſomewhat queſtion whether the Officers of one Church had power to excommunicate in another Church.</p>
            <p>But in theſe points I was no Independent.</p>
            <p>Firſt, I could not be clear that the people were the <hi>firſt ſubject</hi> of the power of the Keyes.</p>
            <p>Secondly, neither that the Fraternity had power to ordain <hi>formally.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, that a Miniſter ſhould preach onely as a gifted broth er out of his owne place.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, I could not conſent to have the godly people taken away from a godly Presbyterian, into an Independent Church.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, I could not approve that Independent Churches ſhould
<pb facs="tcp:117994:7"/>refuſe to communicate with Presbyteriall Churches, though there were good ſtore of viſible Saints, for want of an explicite Covenant.</p>
            <p>By this time, I hope I ſhall be no ranke Independent: But where is then my thanging of my principles? let theſe men prove it, for I am the ſame ſtill, onely ſince I read Mr. <hi>Hudſon,</hi> I doe ſomewhat waver about the <hi>firſt ſubject</hi> of the Keyes and this is all my change.</p>
            <p>That my minde may be cleared againſt whom I write; I obſerve Separatiſts are not all of a ſize; ſome ſeparate from Miniſters &amp; Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and get into their private houſes, owne no officers, but pleaſe themſelves with their owne gifts and opinions; theſe are the perſons whom I chiefly aime at, as ſuch that ſo trouble us, that no Church-diſcipline can hold ſo long as they ſtand.</p>
            <p>Others live in places where there are viſible and reall Saints, the Miniſtry godly, and able, yea, it may be called to the place by theſe perſons, but becauſe they cannot have all they would picking a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell with the Ordination of their Miniſter, &amp;c. they chooſe ſome other Miniſter in ſome other Towne, and ſo depart from the Preby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial to a Congregational Church, continuing ſtill in the ſame Pariſh; It is well theſe men hold up Ordinances and Officers, yet the grounds of their practice the enſuing Diſcourſe will try. I am ſure, peace and unity among Churches cannot poſſibly ſtand with this practice; it is very ſad that we ſhould not yeeld a little, where we <hi>may,</hi> nay where we <hi>ought,</hi> for peace with our brethren whom we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but judge holy and ſincere.</p>
            <p>If there ſhould ſometimes fall out a quotation ſomewhat ſharp, yet I pray doe not thinke that I apply it to all Separatiſts, but to ſome among them, who may deſerve it.</p>
            <p>What ſucceſſe my poore endeavours ſhall finde, I know not, I looke for little good they ſhall doe amongſt the Separatiſts, who with an imperious ſcorn neglect to liſten to, or read any thing, which tends to overthrow their practice; and though they be ſo confuted, as they are not able to anſwer a word, yet they ſcorne to acknowledge their error, and returne to the Congregations, from which they have ſeparated, which to me is a clear demonstration, that however theſe men pretend conſcience, yet it is no ſuch thing; for were theſe men lead by a pure conſcience, conſidering how they ſeparate from holy men, ſuch alſo as have beene inſtruments of their ſoules good, conſidering alſo how they weaken their hands, grieve their ſpirits, they would heare, read, pray, take any courſe, that they might be ſure to be found in the truth.

            <p>Many were the errours that were confuted, condemned in the firſt Synod in <hi>New England,</hi> which errours I finde here in <hi>England,</hi> but there was not this errour amongſt them all (to my remembrance:) it was wont to be ſaid of <hi>Africa,</hi> that every

The Lord ſave us from our owne hearts. But I will now prove the <hi>Theſis,</hi> as I ſaid before, there are true viſible Churches in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Where there are many Societies of viſible Saints, and true Miniſters, conſenting together to worſhip God in his holy Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, there are true viſible Churches.</p>
            <p>But in <hi>England,</hi> there are many Societies of viſible Saints, and true Miniſters conſenting together to worſhip God in his holy Ordinances, <hi>Ergo,</hi> in <hi>England</hi> there are many true viſible Churches.</p>
            <p>The Major is ſo plaine, that none who know what a viſible Church is, and what the Churches in the Goſpel were, but muſt needs yeeld it.</p>
            <p>Here are the eſſentiall cauſes of a Church; <hi>Ergo,</hi> here is a Church.</p>
            <p>Firſt, here is the materiall cauſe, Viſible Saints, the Miniſters alſo, as viſible Saints, help make up the matter; but as they are <hi>Miniſters</hi> they make the Churches Organicall (which is more.)</p>
            <p n="2">2 Here is the formall cauſe, their conſenting to worſhip God, &amp;c. he that yeelds the eſſentiall cauſes, and yet denies the effect, hath loſt his reaſon.</p>
            <p>A Church, is any company of Saints in body, to ſet up what Ordinances of God they know; This is a true Church, and here God dwels,
<note place="margin">In <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 8.1.</note> ſaith Mr. <hi>Burroughs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He ſpeakes of a Church, as it is a Homogeneall body, but I goe further; the Separatiſts indeed will catch hold of his defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, as <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſaith, the Schiſmaticks in his time did of that text, in <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.20. to which eh anſwered very well, <hi>De u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nita Eccleſ.</hi> and hence they will conclude, we are Saints in bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; <hi>ergo</hi> we are true Churches.</p>
            <p>But I pray, are there not viſible Saints alſo in the Churches, from which you irregularly (as I ſhall prove after) did ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate? Are they not as good as your ſelves? Did not you attain to that viſibility of Saint-ſhip, which you have, while you were in thoſe Churches? Doe you ſet up the Ordinances of God ſo farre as you know (or may know, if errour doth not hinder) as they doe from whom you have ſeparated? Nay, you cannot
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:117994:8"/>doe it, for you neither have men fit for Office, nor will you en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure to come under Officers; and therefore if you looke into the ninth verſe of the ſame Chapter,

            <p>All the quarrell will be about the Miniſters,
<note place="margin">The Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians ſpeake the ſame Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, if the words <hi>in Body</hi> pleaſe you, the <hi>Correlatum</hi> of Eccleſiaſticall Power is a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple embodied in a Church, or a Spirituall cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration, <hi>Gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſp.</hi> Aar. rod. 191.

But to take away that Cavill, and ſo to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to the Miniſters, you may know what Mr. <hi>B.</hi> meanes by being <hi>in body,</hi> by ſhewing what makes a Church Covenant; ſaith he, <hi>I know nothing more is required, but to manifeſt their aſſent, to joyne with that Body, to ſet up all the Ordinances of Chriſt, ſo farre as they know.</hi> And doe not thoſe viſible Saints actually manifeſt their aſſent by their continuall attendance upon their Officers in all the Ordinances of God, and maintaining their Officers to that intent, that they may have the Ordinances of Chriſt ſet up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them? Shall the want of an Adjunct null the Church, when as they do the very thing, which they ſhould expreſſe? Put caſe you expreſſe your aſſent, and doe not the things which you expreſs your aſſent unto, are you therefore a Church, becauſe of your expreſſing your aſſent? What then are thoſe who doe the things, though they doe not expreſſe their aſſent in words, but in Acts? This is good, and ſufficient to prove the eſſence, though both expreſſion and doing is <hi>better,</hi> but of this more after.</p>
            <p>But the Miniſters are thoſe who ſpoyle all; there are thoſe who cannot deny there are Ordinances, but there are none to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter them; and this was the reaſon, which one of the chiefe Members of a Church in <hi>London</hi> (who did uſe to Propheſie (as they call it) in the abſence or wearineſſe of the Paſtor) gave to an honeſt man, who was troubled, becauſe he fell off from the Church, and exerciſing his gifts, and turned Seeker. I name not the man, nor the Church, but it is too true.</p>
            <p>Now ſuppoſe I could not prove the Miniſters to be true Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, yet thoſe viſible Saints which I named before, and thoſe whom you call <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> doe meet together, conferre, pray, and faſt together; watch one over another, and ſo, if you wil
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:117994:9"/>conſider them as Homogeneall Bodies, they are as good Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches as thoſe Separatiſts, which have no Officers; therefore ſtill there are true viſible Churches in <hi>England,</hi> beſides the Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts, and ſo my Argument ſtands firme. But I will prove there are many true Miniſters, even amongſt thoſe, whom you call Presbyterial Miniſters, thus:</p>
            <p>Where there are men ſufficiently qualified by God, orderly (at leaſt for ſubſtance) called to the Miniſtry, and doe that worke, which Chriſt appointed his Miniſters to doe, there are true Goſpel-Miniſters.</p>
            <p>But in many of the Churches of <hi>England,</hi> there are ſuch men, <hi>ergo</hi> in many of the Churches of <hi>England</hi> there are true Goſpel-Miniſters.</p>
            <p>I put in the word <hi>many,</hi>
               <note place="margin">I dare ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture farre here, but that I would ſave my ſelfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thoſe whom I oppoſe.</note> becauſe I am ſure I ſhal maintaine my ground, for why ſhould I have undertaken to prove that all the Miniſters in <hi>England</hi> are true Goſpel-miniſters? and that in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Parochiall Congregation in the blinde corners of <hi>England,</hi> there are ſuch viſible Saints, as ought to be, in the conſtitution of a Church (enough I meane to make a Church) I ſhould have had a hard taske; but by this word <hi>many</hi> I include abundance both Churches and Miniſters, beſides our Congregationall Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters; now to my Argument.</p>

            <p>Now for the minor, that there are many ſuch Miniſters in <hi>England,</hi> we ſhall ſee;</p>
            <p n="1">1 For the efficient cauſe, there is no controverſie there.</p>
            <p n="2">2 For the materiall, that they are ſufficiently qualified in that ſence above mentioned, who can deny it? many, yea abundance
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:117994:9"/>qualified with reall grace, and experimentall workings on their owne hearts, beſides their Miniſteriall qualifications, and theſe many others have, who it may be have not the former, as could be wiſhed; but I hope, though ſome doe whiſper, yet they will not undertake to defend it, that there can be no true Miniſter, unleſſe he have reall Grace: I have heard ſome that have affirmed as much, but they are not ſuch as dare undertake the Queſtion. But as for Miniſteriall qualifications, I doe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve the gifts of Miniſters were never larger then now; ſince the Apoſtles dayes never were the truths of God more clearly layed open then now; God doth ſeeme to give out ſuch large meaſures in theſe dayes, as it were in oppoſition to this wild Generation, that when they are crying out, there are no Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, God confutes them, by pouring out more of his Spirit in point of Miniſteriall abilities upon them, then before; indeed where other holy men have gone before in ſuch Pariſhes, and places thereabouts, we finde not that preaching workes now, as it did when it came new to the places, yet I ſay the gifts of Miniſters now are as ſtrong, as they were before; but this is one of the Miniſters heavie burdens in our dayes, their Trading is dead.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, formall cauſe: Our Miniſters, abundance of them are orderly called (for ſubſtance:) there are but two things that I know of to make up this call, Election and Ordination: For election, many, if not all, of the godly Miniſters are elected by the people, ſome by the whole Pariſh, and others by the beſt in the Pariſhes. But you ſay the <hi>Patron</hi> preſents: It is true, but not ſo, as to bring one in againſt the conſent of the people: Verily for Patrons to preſent an unworthy Miniſter, and bring him in againſt the conſent, eſpecially of the godly, and orthodox Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, it is an act of cruell Tyranny, and worthy of a Petition to the Parliament to get ſuch an horrible abuſe removed; but you have a way now to helpe your ſelves againſt ſcandalous Miniſters by the Civill-power, and ſhould have had it by Church-power, if once Diſcipline were ſet up.</p>
            <p>But if the Miniſter be not an unworthy man, though the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron did preſent, as in former times, and he came in without the conſent of the people at the firſt, but had it afterwards; this makes his election good: Hear what the <hi>New England</hi> Miniſters ſay to this point: <hi>Yet ſometimes the peoples acceptance and approbation af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:117994:10"/>may ſupply the want of election at the firſt,
<note place="margin">Anſ. to the 32. Queſt. p. 69.

            </p>
            <p>But are all theſe Separatiſts ſo regular? I doubt not: I can give inſtance of a <hi>Weaver,</hi> who lived in a Towne, where I had my abode for a little time; the Miniſter of the place was a very able man, regularly called, and inclining at that time to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregationall way; yet this <hi>Weaver</hi> (I thinke that was his calling) ſeparated from him, and the other Chriſtians, and had his owne ſociety, to whom he did preach (as they ſaid) but when the winde did ſettle in the Independent quarter; this <hi>Weaver</hi> had a minde to a Pulpit, but I hope then he will looke to his orderly calling; he will not dare to venture but by the Goſpel-way, that now we ſhall judge; his way of election was this, as an honeſt Chriſtian of the ſame Towne, and one of this mans friends told me, that Goodman <hi>B.</hi> an honeſt Carrier being a Sequeſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor in the Towne, he puts him in, and this is one part of his calling, as for Ordination that is a Toy: But is this regular? then let theſe Separatiſts for ever hold their tongues; I know not, but if a Sequeſtrator may put a <hi>Weaver</hi> (let him be a godly and a <hi>pretty</hi> man, as ſome ſay he is, I love not to judge other folkes godlineſſe, I have enough to doe at home) into a Pariſh, when as the people call him not, then may a Patron put in able and godly Divines into their Pariſhes with the peoples conſent firſt or laſt: as the noble Earle of <hi>Warwick,</hi> I beleeve hath helped many Pariſhes to as able godly Divines, as any one Sequeſtrator hath done. I could give the Reader inſtances of others, but ſo much I perceive by theſe kinde of men, that I little regard what they ſay, for if there lye any matter of advantage in their way, they will ſtretch their principles, as far as they pleaſe.</p>
            <p>As for their ſufficient qualification, which ſhould make the materiall cauſe of a Miniſter, we muſt not queſtion them in our dayes: <hi>Paul</hi> indeed ſaid, <hi>Who is ſufficient for theſe things?</hi> our lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage is, <hi>Who is not ſufficient for theſe things?</hi> much might here be ſaid (I am privy to mine own inſufficiency, and deſire to bewail it) but let me propound one thing to theſe men, and ſee how they anſwer it. Amongſt the opinions which Mrs. <hi>Hutchiſon</hi> had brought forth in <hi>New Eng.</hi> this was one, <hi>That there was no inherent
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:117994:10"/>grace in a beleever, no new creature, nothing but Jeſus Chriſt, and he was the new creature;</hi> one of Mrs. <hi>Hutchiſons</hi> followers, on a Lords day ſtood up in the Congregation, and would defend it againſt the learned and reverend Teacher, and told him the text was read ſo in the original, <hi>If any man be in Chriſt, the new creature,</hi> 2 Cor. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>.17. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, what can theſe men ſay to this that know not the Originall, nor Grammar, both which a man muſt know to anſwer this: ſo if another ſhould defend a hereſie, and tell you the text is ſo in the Hebrew: for the Jeſuits ſubtle and crabbed diſputations, we muſt not mention them, theſe men are doubtleſſe ſufficient; not but that I could allow a ſolid, humble, experienced, orthodox, and well-gifted Chriſtian, called regularly, and ſet apart to the worke of the Miniſtry, with the neighbour-hood of ſome learned able Divine to have his recourſe to, I ſay, I could allow ſuch a one to preach in dark corners of the land. But when men will cry out of other Miniſters for want of orderly calling, ſeparate from them, and thus carry themſelves, that the bones of their ambition ſticke out, and then through unfoundneſſe in opinion, though no way able, though not regularly called, yet they will get into Livings and Pulpits, this is abominable.</p>
            <p>So much for Election, that part of their calling will hold; as for the other requiſite, <hi>Ordination,</hi> to prove our Miniſters have that alſo; (for the ſubſtance of it) here will lye the pinch of the controverſie, therefore I reſerve it for another place.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, for the finall cauſe, here alſo the Miniſters will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare to be true Miniſters; for converſion and edification, the Lord hath honoured the Engliſh Miniſtry with as much ſucceſſe, as any Nation under heaven; the Lord hath ſet ſeale to hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds of our Miniſters, in giving them ſome ſoules in conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and building up many, according as are their ſeverall gifts; and for a proofe of it, let me appeale to your ſelves, who have thus ſeparated from them: Cannot you ſay, that you have found God in their Miniſtry? I am ſure your owne words muſt wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe againſt divers of you, if you deny it, for you have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged, by them you were firſt awakened, and brought home: Now I beſeech you conſider what you doe, you who are the ſobereſt, and retaine the ſavour of God in your hearts: If Chriſt ſhall ſay to you, <hi>Why doe you deny theſe to be true Miniſters? I owne them to be ſuch, I have qualified them with Miniſterial and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:117994:11"/>gifts; I have ſealed to their Miniſtry, by making them my inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to bring home many, and to build up thoſe, who were brought home: I have often humbled, awed, cheared, refreſhed the hearts of my people by them, your owne ſelves (who are mine) are witneſſes of it, I found you out by them, &amp;c. They had their call from the people, and though there were ſome circumſtantiall defects in their ſetting apart to the worke, yet thoſe they freely acknowledge, and I doe as freely pardon, will not my preſence with them make up that defect in your hearts, ſtill to owne them, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence them, as my Miniſters, ſince I doe?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now I ſay, what would you anſwer to the Lord Jeſus? I doubt not, though many have their infirmities (as who have not many infirmities) yet Chriſt doth owne them for his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, and <hi>Paul,</hi> or the Apoſtles, if they now were alive, would not deny it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> If you ſay, that indeed God did goe along with the old Miniſters, but not with theſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> But the ſame argument you give againſt theſe Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters from their Ordination, doth make as much againſt theſe old Miniſters, as theſe now living, they were no true Miniſters neither by your opinion.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We can ſay, that even with the labours of theſe Miniſters doth Chriſt goe along, though not ſo much as he did before, when the Goſpel came firſt into places, for edification we finde it, which is one end in that <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.12. and I pray take heed that your ſcorning of them, be no occaſion to hinder their worke, for you muſt anſwer for it, what ever the Decrees of God be. So much for my firſt argument.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I would uſe a ſecond argument to prove we have true Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, &amp;c. And here I would propound one queſtion to theſe men, who thus deny the Miniſtry: It is this, <hi>Were there ever any true Miniſters and Churches</hi> (let me put in them alſo) <hi>ſince the Apoſtles dayes?</hi> I hope you will ſay yes: But I pray how long were there ſuch Miniſters and Churches? in which Century did there ceaſe to be true Miniſters, and true viſible Churches? I ſuppoſe you will ſay, when Antichriſt began (here now you would doe us a good turne, if you could make it out cleare to us when that was, that ſo we might know how long our mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries ſhall laſt) if ſo, then to be ſure for the firſt three hundred yeares after Chriſt, which were times of perſecution, yea, and divers yeares after, you muſt grant there were true Miniſters.
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:117994:11"/>Let us then compare our Miniſters, and Churches with them; for our Miniſters, many are godly, as well as thoſe, all the Miniſters then were not truly gracious I beleeve; nay by ſtories we can learne they were not. As for Miniſteriall gifts, thoſe who have skill to compare the workes, and Sermons of our Miniſters now, with their workes and Homilies, ſhall finde that the Presbyterial Miniſters are not behinde them, but in opening the doctrines of <hi>Free-grace, Chriſt, promiſes,</hi> which are the glory of the Goſpel, as alſo for diſcovering of <hi>Hypocriſie</hi> (without any diſhonour to thoſe Ancients,) I may ſay they do excell them.</p>
            <p>For the Churches, it is true, we know not what we ſhould doe, if the Lord ſhould call us to ſufferings; but this we know, the ſame power, which carried them through, is able to carry us through: for loſſes of eſtates, leaving of their native Country, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I am ſure <hi>New England</hi> hath gone very far with them for that kinde of ſuffering, and ſo have ſome here alſo, yea, and for not ſubmitting to ſuperſtitious Ceremonies, and inventions of men in the worſhip of God, which they even in thoſe times made nothing of: How many vaine rites and ceremonies were then uſed in Baptiſme,
<note n="*" place="margin">By <hi>Tertul. Cyp.</hi> Ep. 59 The kiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the childe. By <hi>August.</hi> time there were many Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies added <hi>Symb. ad Catech. l.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 1. <hi>Lib. de Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro. mil.</hi> Ep. 70.72. <hi>Tertul. de Bap.</hi>
               </note> which our Miniſters did never owne, but were ſilenced, &amp;c. for leſſe matters, yet theſe were the primitive Churches.</p>
            <p>Beſides thoſe Ceremonies in Baptiſme, there were other ſtrange things uſed, which our Divines never owned, I ſay, in thoſe primitive Churches.</p>
            <p>As the Anointing of the baptized, As <hi>Cyprian, It is neceſſary that the baptized perſon be anointed, &amp;c.</hi> yea, and puts much in it, as one may ſee, who reads thoſe Epiſtles.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tertullian</hi> alſo makes mention of this.</p>
            <p>Hence <hi>Fabianus</hi> ordered, that this oyle ſhould be prepared every yeare, and reprehended thoſe, who kept it two or three yeares together, in <hi>ſecunda Epiſt. and Epiſc. orient.</hi> Hence alſo care was taken afterwards, that none but Biſhops ſhould make this, the Presbyters muſt not dare to doe it. <hi>Sylveſter in Concil. Rom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Alſo holy Veſtures for the Miniſters to be uſed onely in the Churches; many of ours never owned theſe,
<note place="margin">Epiſt. <hi>Steph ad Hil.</hi>
               </note> all have caſt them away.</p>
            <p>Alſo in the Lords Supper, the mixing of water with the wine, which how ever ſome ſay, it was becauſe of the hot Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:117994:12"/>yet <hi>Alexander,</hi> who they ſay was the firſt that mixed wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with wine,
<note place="margin">Epiſt. ad omnes Ortho. Apol. 2.</note> doth not give that reaſon, but becauſe <hi>water and blood came out of Chriſts ſide.</hi> In <hi>Juſtin Martyrs</hi> time, it ſeemes this was their manner alſo, but this was not the Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Alſo we find ſeverall Church-officers among them, as appears by <hi>Gaius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> who ordered, that all the orders in the Church muſt aſcend, from the door-keeper to the Biſhop. <hi>Oſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius, Lector, Exorciſta, Acolythus, Subdiaconus, Diaconus, Presbyter, Epiſcopus.</hi> The ordination of theſe Officers, with their Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies are after ſet downe in the fourth Councel of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If the Decretals of <hi>Gaius</hi> be of any Authority, all theſe were in primitive Churches, before <hi>Conſtantine</hi> came to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire.</p>
            <p>More things I might adde, but I forbeare.</p>
            <p>And though there were many glorious Martyrs, yet all their Church-members were not ſuch, many did yeeld to the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theniſh Idolatry, when perſecution began, yea, and there were foul ſins among them Churches, as Adultery, Whoredome (yea, even among thoſe, who had beene Confeſſors, as <hi>Cyprian</hi> affirmes, <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gemiſcimus</hi> ſaith he, to ſee it) drunkenneſſe, ſwearing, and what not, as any one may well gather, who is but a little verſed in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity,
<note place="margin">De unita Eccleſ.</note> and by reading over the Canons made in their Councels, we may learne what they were troubled with.</p>
            <p>As for the Miniſters, they alſo were ordained by Biſhops (though they were not ſuch lordly ones as ours were) with Presbyters joyning with them, this no man can deny that knows any thing of thoſe times; whence then I am bold to affirme, that if there were true Miniſters, and true viſible Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in thoſe times, even while they were under perſecuting heatheniſh Emperours, then there are true Miniſters, and true vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Churches now in <hi>England,</hi> and if there be none now, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther were there any in thoſe times; but I thinke no man is ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent to deny that there were true Miniſters and Churches in thoſe times. I plead now for many Presbyteriall Miniſters, and their Congregations. So I have done with my ſecond Argument, which if I ſhould draw into forme, it runnes thus:</p>
            <p>If there were true Miniſters, and true viſible Churches in the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:117994:12"/>firſt three hundred yeares after Chriſt, then there are true Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and viſible Churches now in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the Antecedent is true, <hi>ergo</hi> the conſequent is true.</p>
            <p>Some we have that dote, they tell us, they expect men to be ſent from God, and endued with extraordinary gifts, as were the Apoſtles, &amp;c, and theſe are the men, who ſhall ſet up Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and reforme us. Good Lord, whither will our vile hearts carry us, if thou doſt leave them?</p>
            <p>Theſe perſons are not worth the anſwering, but yet let me ſay a little to them, and ſo paſſe on to the chiefe thing I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend.</p>
            <p>For the gift of Tongues, I need not ſpeake, what is neceſſary God hath given to moſt, and many excell in that gift.</p>
            <p>For Miracles.</p>
            <p>I They were given but for that time, to help on the worke of the Miniſtry (as ſauce doth meat) but now if God doth <hi>that</hi> by the Miniſtry of his Servants without Miracles, <hi>which</hi> he did then by the Miniſtry accompanied with Miracles (viz. <hi>Convert, Edifie, Formalize,</hi> &amp;c.) this doth but more confirme our Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, and prove that God ownes theſe deſpiſed Miniſters. The plaine word preached, hath made as good Chriſtians, as preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and Miracles.</p>
            <p n="2">2 If any Body hath need of the gift of Miracles, then Maſter <hi>Eliot</hi> in <hi>New England</hi> hath, who now preaches to the <hi>Indians,</hi> and others with him; but God carrieth on his worke amongſt the <hi>Indians</hi> without miracles.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Doe not you your ſelves beleeve the Scriptures to be the Word of God? if ſo, what need have you of ſuch kinde of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſo gifted? The greateſt Miracle which I deſire to confirme me in the truth of the Scriptures, is to finde the power of Chriſt his Death, and Reſurrection in my heart, without which I care not for miracles. But enough for theſe.</p>
            <p>There are others, who having been Members of an Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Church, where diviſions have fallen out, and ſo have broke in peeces, they have ſaid, that <hi>Miniſters are not fitted with a ſpirit of Government, to keep Churches in order, and therefore theſe are not times as yet for ſuch Reformation,</hi> I anſwer;</p>
            <p n="1">1 The more ſhame for your <hi>Church-Members,</hi> who are of ſuch proud, and turbulent ſpirits, that godly and able Miniſters are not able enough to governe them; thoſe who come into Church
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:117994:13"/>Communion with the awe of God upon their hearts, we can governe them; ſome ſuch ſpirits we finde among the Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, but if we could ſee more it would be better.</p>
            <p n="2">2 I wonder not at your Diviſions, when I ſee what Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples ſome godly Congregationall men have gone by, for the ordering of their Church Government.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Your Argument is as ſtrong againſt the Apoſtles, for there were Hereſies, and Schiſmes in their dayes.</p>
            <p>But I leave theſe, and return to that, from whence I have made a digreſſion; Having then proved there are true Miniſters, and Churches in <hi>England,</hi> let us examine the grounds, why theſe men ſeparate from theſe Miniſters, and Churches; I conceive their grounds may be referred to one of theſe heads:
<list>
                  <item>
                     <hi>Either to</hi> The Miniſters,</item>
                  <item>
                     <hi>Either to</hi> Or Worſhip,</item>
                  <item>
                     <hi>Either to</hi> Or the Congregation,</item>
                  <item>
                     <hi>Either to</hi> Or the place of meeting;</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>If there be any thing elſe that cannot ſo well be reduced to one of theſe, yet I am ſure I ſhall meet with it, before I have done.</p>
            <p>For the Miniſters, they are indeed made the Dung of <hi>England,</hi> who are more ſcorned then they, eſpecially the Presbyteriall men, be they never ſo holy, or learned? Whether there be juſt cauſe in reſpect of men, I leave it to God to judge; I am ſure when Miniſters were in honour, we found the Word had good effect, but ſince they came to be thus ſcorned, little good hath been done. I deny not but God may have a juſt quarrell againſt us, and give me leave (without offence) to propound the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons why.</p>
            <p n="1">1 The firſt I had rather conceale, becauſe I ſhould ſeem to ſpy out a mote in my Fathers, and Brethrens eyes, when I have a beame in my owne; but therefore I rather propound it, as I heard it from a Reverend and judicious Divine, a man of a gracious and moderate ſpirit, Mr. <hi>Nathaniel Rogers</hi> in <hi>New Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> I was talking with him there, when the newes came of the Covenant that <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> entred into; the thing pleaſed him, and all our Churches exceedingly: This only, (ſaid he) I have not heard of, <hi>That there hath been a generall Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation amongſt the Miniſters, for their yeelding ſo much to the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious inventions of that Hierarchy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2 I conceive God may juſtly have a quarrell againſt us (the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:117994:13"/>younger ſort of Miniſters) for our wofull conformity to the Faſhions of the times; what long haire now doe we ſee moſt young Miniſters weare, and if any new fond faſhion comes up, who follows it ſooner then they? Who take more liberty here then Independent Miniſters, the younger ſort?</p>
            <p n="3">3 There hath been a too great Idolizing of Learning, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſing it in Sermons, by reciting of the Fathers, or School-men, ſome men fondly making, it may be, a quarter of their Sermons to be Latine, or Greek ſentences out of them, and then turning them into Engliſh, to make people admire them, and conclude them to be great Schollars; not but that it is lawfull to quote a Father, or a Schoole-man: but I ſpeake of that exceſſe, and pride alſo, that went along with it, that they thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſo exalted above the people, and looked on them, as the Phariſees, <hi>Joh.</hi> 7.49. Hence God doth now let Miniſters and Learning be trampled upon. But this was not the fault of thoſe godly men, who now are deſpiſed, as much as the worſt.</p>
            <p n="4">4 There is in ſome young Miniſters a too baſe eſteeme of private Chriſtians, that are not learned; I have heard my ſelfe thoſe, who have ſpoken very contemptibly of them, ſcorning they ſhould have any hand in Church affaires; now it is true, there are abundance of private Chriſtians very weake, but ſome there are, ſolid, underſtanding men; and though we doe not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit theſe to be Governours in the Church (unleſſe choſen to the Office of a Ruling Elder, to joyne with us) yet Miniſters ſhall finde ſometimes, that they have no cauſe to repent, in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving an eare to what they ſay.</p>
            <p>Theſe things I have obſerved, and wiſh (eſpecially for the three latter) that God hath not brought us downe for them. I might have added, ſome young Miniſters ſtudy more quint-eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentiall Notions, curious Phanſies, and pleaſe people much with fine ſpeculations about Chriſt, and Free Grace, but have left the old way of Preaching, which did the good. This Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micall Divinity hath pleaſed mens eares, but not awed, nor humbled mens hearts; it makes frothy, but not ſolid Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians.</p>
            <p>But theſe are not to be imputed to all the Presbyterians, who are thus ſcorned.</p>
            <p>But now to the Miniſters.</p>
            <pb n="14" facs="tcp:117994:14"/>
            <p>The generall apprehenſion that theſe men have of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, is that they are Anti-chriſtian Miniſters, and what is more common in their mouthes then to call them ſo? This is a heavie charge, if it could be proved: but this terme <hi>Anti-chriſtian</hi> is both a ſimple terme, a complexe Propoſition, a Syllogiſme, <hi>i. e.</hi> they think it ſufficient proofe to charge them with it, though hundreds of theſe know no more then a Babe, wherein the forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Anti-chriſtianiſme doth conſiſt, but every thing that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſes them, that is <hi>Antichriſtian;</hi> Infant Baptiſm is <hi>Anti-chriſtian,</hi> the Ordination of Miniſters is Anti-chriſtian, ſinging of Pſalms is Anti-chriſtian, it is proofe ſufficient, they have ſaid it; now this ſeemes to me very ſtrange, that thoſe men, who Inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally, 1. Convert men to Chriſt. 2. Build up men in Chriſt. 3. Oppoſe Anti-chriſt to the utmoſt. 4. Who have caſt off Anti-chriſt. 5. If they were under Anti-chriſts power, ſhould ſoon finde his favour to be Fire and Faggot, yet theſe men to be called <hi>Anti-chriſtians,</hi> I ſay with the Text, <hi>The Lord rebuke thee, O Satan:</hi> But if you will take <hi>Anti-chriſt</hi> in a large ſence, why may not thoſe be as truly called <hi>Anti-chriſtians,</hi> who doe throw downe, what Ordinances Chriſt hath ſet up; as, <hi>The Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of the Miniſtry, giving his promiſe to be with it to the end of the world; the Baptizing of the infants of beleeving Parents; ſinging of Pſahnes, any forme of externall Church-Government;</hi> all theſe are throwne downe by moſt of you, and many walke above Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances. I ſay, may not theſe be called as truly <hi>Anti-chriſtians</hi> in a large ſence, who thus throw downe, what Chriſt hath ſet up, as well as thoſe, who ſet up ſuch Ordinances, as Chriſt never did ſet up? (which is one ſigne of Anti-chriſtianiſme.)</p>
            <p>But if you would know what is properly Anti-chriſtianiſme,
<note place="margin">Expoſi. on <hi>Hoſ.</hi> firſt Book, p. 162.</note> I pray take it from a farre more able man then my ſelfe, one well knowne, and that deſerves honour, Mr. <hi>Burroughs;</hi> he well obſerved the madneſſe of people, that cry out againſt any thing, that diſpleaſes them, that it is Anti-chriſtianiſme, then ſets downe thus, wherein it conſiſts.</p>
            <p n="1">1 <hi>Whoſoever ſhall obtrude any Doctrine upon the Church, to be belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by their owne Authority.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2 <hi>The intruſion of ſuch Offices, and Officers in the Church, as meerly belong to the ſpirituall man.</hi>

            </p>
            <pb n="15" facs="tcp:117994:14"/>
            <p n="4">4 <hi>The impoſing of Lawes ſo to binde Conſcience, as the Lawes of Chriſt doe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This, ſaith he, is to ſet up another head. I need not adde <hi>the owning of the Pope as a viſible Monarchical head over the Church,</hi> who doth all that, which Mr. <hi>Burroughs</hi> hath mentioned; but this then I deſire, that any, who thus call the Miniſters <hi>Antichriſtian,</hi> would charge them, and make it good, that they are guilty of any of theſe things, or elſe be aſhamed for ever after to call faithfull Miniſters of Chriſt, <hi>Antichriſtians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But what colour have theſe men for this vile aſperſion, I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver heard but onely this, their <hi>Ordination.</hi> The ſumme of all they ſay, amounts to this, <hi>The Miniſters of England ſtand by a Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh ordination; Ergo, They are no true Goſpel, but Antichriſtian Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters,</hi> this is that, which makes the heavy ſtir in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For anſwer to this, I may ſay as the father of the blinde man, <hi>He is of age, and can ſpeake for himſelf;</hi> ſo the Presbyterial Miniſters are of ability ſufficient to ſpeake, and have ſpoken enough in anſwer to this cavill, to ſatisfie ſober mindes; but what will ſatisfie unreaſonable men? I am not very willing to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt upon this, becauſe I can ſpeak but little, which hath not beene ſpoken before (for the ſubſtance) but yet this being an ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient unto the formall cauſe of a Miniſter (which I have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned before, and promiſed to prove, that for the ſubſtance of the Ordinance our Miniſters have it) I muſt ſpeake a few words in anſwer to their cavils againſt it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Ordination of theſe Miniſters, ſay they, came from the Romiſh Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogue, they alſo were ordained by Biſhops,</hi> Ergo, <hi>They are no true Miniſters, hence we ſeparate from them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I anſwer,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, had I thought there had beene ſuch a ſtirre in <hi>England</hi> about this, I ſhould have laboured to have underſtood the minds of our Elders in <hi>New England</hi> about it; all the time I was there, I never heard the queſtion moved, whether they did look on that Ordination they had here, as true (for ſubſtance) or not. But this I dare boldly affirme for them;</p>
            <p n="1">1 That they doe looke upon abundance of our Presbyteriall Miniſters, as true Miniſters of Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2 I know that they will diſapprove of the practice of ſome, who have ſeparated from the Miniſters, whom they have before choſen, and the godly Congregations, upon this notion, as I
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:117994:15"/>know ſome have done,
<note place="margin">I do ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour the grace of divers of thoſe Chriſtians who ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, but Satan got into an Angel of light, and deceived</note> eſpecially from that famous Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of <hi>Dedham,</hi> of which I dare ſay, that for a Parochial Congregation, there is not the like number of reall and viſible Saints in any Congregation in <hi>England;</hi> I am ſure there was not before this Separation was made; and for the Miniſters I ſpeake not of them, they are men well knowne. I wiſh I had nothing more to trouble me, then to live under that Miniſtry in that Congregation, I hope whereas now I am a ſad man, I ſhould be as chearfull as any man in <hi>England.</hi> Mr. <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughs</hi> ſaid, he could communicate in that Congregation, then it ſeemes hee did not queſtion whether there were any true Miniſters.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But if you ſay, <hi>Our New England Miniſters doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce their Ordination which they had here, for they are ordained againe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi>
               <note place="margin">See Anſw. to 32. q. 70</note> Its true, they are ordained againe, but I never heard it was upon that ground, for let a Miniſter be ordained there in one Church, if there be cauſe of his removall, and ſo be elected in another Church, they ordaine him againe.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, I can ſay this, our <hi>New England</hi> Miniſters have often deſired, and frequently admitted to preach in their Congregations, that went from hence, but were not ordained there.</p>
            <p>But our Miniſters of <hi>New England</hi> are here judged nothing worth, but are as contemptible as any, in the mouths of our Separatiſts, yet they are men of worth.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I anſwer to what you ſay, <hi>It came through, and from the Romiſh Synagogue.</hi> If your argument have any force, you muſt caſt it thus:</p>
            <p>Thoſe Miniſters which ſtand by a <hi>Romiſh Inſtitution,</hi> are no true Miniſters of Chriſt. But the Miniſters of <hi>England</hi> ſtand by a <hi>Romiſh Inſtitution; Ergo,</hi> the Miniſters of <hi>England</hi> are no true Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>The <hi>major</hi> you will grant, and if we can prove the <hi>minor,</hi> our Miniſters ſhall utterly renounce their <hi>Ordination,</hi> I dare under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take for them; but the <hi>minor</hi> is very falſe, they ſtand by no <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh Inſtitution:</hi> for Ordination is none of their inventions, but inſtituted by the Lord Jeſus himſelfe, long before Antichriſt was. But your Argument runs thus:</p>
            <p>Thoſe Miniſters which ſtand by an Inſtitution of Chriſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:117994:15"/>to them from the Apoſtles through the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> they are no true Miniſters of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>But the Miniſters of <hi>England</hi> ſtand by an Inſtitution of Chriſt, deſcending to them from the Apoſtles through the Church of <hi>Rome, Ergo,</hi> They are no true Miniſters.</p>
            <p>This is the true meaning of your Argument, but the major is very falſe: ſhall the paſſing through <hi>Rome</hi> null the Inſtitutions of Chriſt? did not the Scriptures, Sacraments, and what ever Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances we now have, deſcend to us from the Apoſtles through <hi>Rome?</hi> Shall we therefore caſt them away? That Argument runnes as ſtrong againſt our Baptiſme, and any other Ordinance, with which though the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> mingled their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions, did they therefore null the Ordinance? the veſſels that were once dedicated to God by his owne Inſtitution, though they were put into the houſe of <hi>Nebuchadnezzars</hi> gods, and thoſe that were fit, very like uſed by <hi>Belſhazzar</hi> to drinke wine in, when he praiſed the gods &amp;c. they were not ſo much as new caſt againe, but carried to <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ezra 1.7. ad fin.</note>
            </p>
            <p>I pray what doe you thinke of the judgement of Mr. <hi>Johnſon?</hi> a man great, I am ſure, among the brethren of the Separation (though the Separatiſts in our dayes make a tuſh at the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of any man, yea, although he were of the Separation; but yet conſider the reaſons which ſwayed him, and then judge.) The caſe was this, One that was a Miniſter in the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> was after choſen Teacher to a ſeparate Congregation, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any new <hi>Impoſing of hands,</hi> this he undertakes to juſtifie thus:</p>
            <p n="1">1 <hi>Impoſition of hands is of God, and not an invention of man: It was not a poſtor threſhold firſt brought by Antichriſt into the Temple of God, but had therein afore Antichriſt ſate there.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Baptiſme and Impoſition of hands are joyned together among the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of the foundation ſpoken of,</hi> Heb. 6.2. <hi>therefore it ought to be regarded.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Impoſition of hands is in the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>ſtill given to the office of the Miniſtry, and in the name of the Lord, as they doe alſo ſtill adminiſter Baptiſme.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>We found not either precept, example, or ground in the Scripture binding us to the repetition of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>The Prieſts and Levites in Iſrael becoming unclean, when after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward they were cleanſed, retained ſtill their places of being Prieſts, and Levites; and the children of the Prieſts and Levites ſucceeding after them, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>id adminiſter without a new anointing, or new impoſition of hands &amp;c.</hi>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:117994:16"/>Thus then, as Mr. <hi>Johnſon</hi> and Mr. <hi>Ainſworth</hi> oppoſed Rebaptiza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, becauſe Baptiſme is an Ordinance of God, which was had in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> before ſhe fell into <hi>Apoſtaſie,</hi> and hath been there continued ever ſince the Apoſtles times (how ever co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingled with many inventions of their owne:) ſo Mr. <hi>Johnſon</hi> defended the Ordination of that Miniſter, which he had in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> becauſe Impoſition of hands was in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> from the Apoſtles times, before her Apoſtaſie, and is there continued to this day, though mixed with many pollutions of their owne.</p>
            <p>I pray onely note this, that whereas I ſay, they ſtand by their <hi>Ordination,</hi> I doe not meane that onely, but alſo they have the election of the people, of which I ſpake before, and that the Separatiſts cannot deny, which yet they make the greateſt mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in a Miniſters call.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, I anſwer, If this argument be of any force, it would rather prevaile againſt the firſt <hi>Reformers,</hi> as in other Nations, ſo againſt our firſt <hi>Reformers</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> who came newly out of Popery; but what is this to us, who have beene above ninety yeares out of that bondage, and have caſt off their Government, Worſhip, and Doctrine (ſo farre as Antichriſtian) for a long time; but if our firſt <hi>Reformers</hi> were able enough to maintaine their call, then much more our Miniſters.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, but if you will throw away all that comes through <hi>Rome,</hi> let us ſee what courſe you will take, when you have denied all the Ordinances, that have beene adminiſtred for theſe ninety yeares in <hi>England</hi> [for if no Miniſtry, then cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly no Authoritative preaching, no Sacraments] and thus you have renounced yuor Baptiſme, which you had by theſe Miniſters; what method will you take in your Reformation? how will you come to be re-baptized? you will tell me, <hi>You will cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant together, and then elect and ordaine a Miniſter, and he ſhall baptize:</hi> Of this more afterward.</p>
            <p>But let me examine what you ſay at preſent; <hi>You will covenant together</hi> (ſuppoſing your ſelves to be Saints firſt) ſay you ſo? are you Saints by calling? how came you to be ſo? what did God call you immediately? No, you muſt ſay many (if not all) of you, who have any truth of grace, by the preaching of the word; what, by thoſe Miniſters from whom you ſeparate, as no Miniſters, becauſe of their Ordination? hath the Lord ſo farre
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:117994:16"/>owned his deſpiſed members, as to make them the inſtruments to bring you to be viſible Saints, fit to imbody or covenant, &amp;c? and are theſe now no Miniſters? are you the effect of their Miniſteriall labours, and they no Miniſters? Surely in this one thing you have overthrowne your ſelves; but then you ſay, <hi>you will ordaine him,</hi> this I will conſider in its owne place; Then <hi>he ſhall baptize:</hi> but ſince he did renounce his owne baptiſme alſo, who ſhall baptize him firſt? you muſt have a Miniſter to do that, to be ſure he cannot doe it himſelfe, nor none of you, for you are private perſons; to adminiſter the Lords Supper before you be baptiſed, is contrary to Scripture rules.</p>
            <p>There was a report when I was in <hi>New England,</hi> that a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penter re-baptiſed Mr. <hi>Williams,</hi>
               <note place="margin">In <hi>Iuſt. Mar.</hi> time none re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Supper, but ſuch as were firſt bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, <hi>Apol.</hi> 2. <hi>Ius Divi. Apend. p.</hi> 269.</note> and then he did re-baptize the reſt: I do not ſtand to defend the thing whether it be true or no, but it was like enough to be true, and ſutable to the other opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions and practiſes of that wilde generation. Where are we now?</p>
            <p>Fifthly, that is very obſervable, which the <hi>London</hi> Miniſters have added in the defence of their Ordination, <q>That in this Church of <hi>England,</hi> the corruptions which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> would have introduced about Ordination of Miniſters and other Eccleſiaſticall affaires, were withſtood and oppoſed by the Kings of <hi>England:</hi> Nor doe we read of any Miniſters that were ordained by any <hi>Agents</hi> ſent from <hi>Rome,</hi> but onely ſome idle <hi>ceremonies of Confirmation,</hi> or them that were ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the <hi>Pall</hi> and the <hi>Ring</hi> brought thence into <hi>England.</hi>
               </q> Thus far the <hi>London Miniſters:</hi> In the margent they have ſet downe the Authours that prove it.</p>
            <p>Sixtly, There might be another anſwer given by ſome, who are good <hi>Hiſtorians,</hi> [which I confeſſe I am not, wanting both time and ſuch bookes] ſo farre as I can goe, I will. That the Churches in <hi>England</hi> were at firſt rightly gathered and conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted, it is not to be doubted,
<note place="margin">

<note place="margin">p. 147.</note> the Story ſaith by them, all the Clergy and the Chriſtian Miniſters of the Britains were then utterly driven out, in ſo much that the Arch-biſhops of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Yorke</hi> went into <hi>Wales:</hi> thus
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:117994:17"/>long then it ſeemes the Miniſters of <hi>England</hi> had no ordination from <hi>Rome;</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 149.</note> this appeares alſo by <hi>Auſtine,</hi> who came into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> in the yeare five hundred ninety eight, he about the yeare ſix hundred,
<note place="margin">P. 153.</note> aſſembled the Biſhops and Doctors of <hi>Britaine</hi> (ſo that ſtill here were Miniſters, but where their abode was, the ſtory ſets not downe, but ſuppoſed to be towards <hi>Wales,)</hi> and charged them to preach the Goſpel to the <hi>Engliſh-men,</hi> and alſo that they ſhould among themſelves reform certain rites in their Church (ſo that ſtill here were Miniſters and Churches) ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally for keeping of Eaſter-tide, baptizing after the manner of <hi>Rome,</hi> &amp;c. to which the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Britaines</hi> would not agree (this ſhews they did not depend upon <hi>Rome.</hi>) Afterward there was another Synod gathered, where ſeven Biſhops of <hi>Britaine</hi> were preſent; and though we finde a great battell fought pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently after, where the <hi>Britains</hi> were overcome, yet the Story doth not mention that the Miniſters were all ſlaine there. Now the thing I aime at is this, that ſince there were ſo many Miniſters and Biſhops in <hi>England,</hi> who had their ordination by ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fion from thoſe Apoſtolical men, and not from <hi>Rome,</hi> and wee finde ſo many, when <hi>Auſtine</hi> came, why may we not ſuppoſe that theſe might againe preach the Goſpel to the <hi>Engliſh-men,</hi> though at firſt they were oppoſite, when they had ſmarted for their folly? and why may we not ſuppoſe they might returne into <hi>England</hi> againe, eſpecially into thoſe parts neare <hi>Wales?</hi> alſo thoſe who were driven out, as the Story ſaith they were, ſuppoſe into ſome other parts, might not they returne into <hi>England?</hi> alſo muſt we take the words of the Story, <hi>(All the Clergy and Chriſtian Miniſters were driven out)</hi> ſtrictly ſo, as none at all were left, though latent, &amp;c? thoſe, who are good Hiſtorians, may helpe here, and it would be ſome anſwer to that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection of our ordination coming from <hi>Rome,</hi> though unto me, the objection is very feeble, if this anſwer cannot be made out.</p>
            <p>As for the Churches of <hi>England,</hi> being rightly at firſt gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
<note place="margin">Way of Ch. in N. E. Ch. 7. p. 111.</note> as above mentioned; Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> yeelds it, ſo as he ſaith, <hi>That all the work now is, not to make them Churches, which were none before, but to reduce, and reſtore them to their primitive Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To that part of the Objection, <hi>They were ordained by Biſhops;</hi> I pray what doe you thinke of Maſter <hi>Bradford,</hi> and the reſt of
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:117994:17"/>thoſe holy Miniſters and Martyrs that were ordained by the Biſhops in thoſe dayes, <hi>Cranmer, Ridley, Hooper,</hi> &amp;c? was he an <hi>Anti-chriſtian Miniſter,</hi> and all thoſe Miniſters, who were then ordained, though now they were ſcarce got out of the Popiſh Ceremonies? &amp;c. the holy Martyrs then did never offer to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate from Mr. <hi>Bradford,</hi> and the reſt, nor call them Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian Miniſters. I pray how many ſuch <hi>Bradfords</hi> have you among you? Not all the Separatiſts in <hi>England</hi> can afford ſuch a one; Chriſt cals him his faithfull Miniſter, but you ſay Mr. <hi>Bradford</hi> is none; curſed be that doctrine. Now if thoſe Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters were true Miniſters, though they had an Epiſcopall Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, then ſo are ours, notwithſtanding their Ordination by Biſhops. It is vaine to ſay thoſe Biſhops were godly men, ſo were ot ours: for it is a bold aſſertion to ſay, that none of the Biſhops ſince have been godly men, no doubt there are divers in Heaven. And beſides, it is abſurd to thinke, that the truth and efficacy of an Ordinance depends upon the truth of Grace in him who doth adminiſter it; as for Ceremonies, if you ſearch, they were not cleare then, no more then our Biſhops were.</p>
            <p>It is a ſilly ſhift to ſay, They walked according to their light; I hope there was the ſame rule to judge of the truth of Miniſters then, that is now; it was not their <hi>light</hi> which made them true Miniſters, but the <hi>rule.</hi> But the truth of their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry was never queſtioned, till our Separatiſts roſe up, who are not comparable to them in parts, or holineſſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2 I pray, what doe you make of thoſe Miniſters who were ordained in the Primitive Churches?

            <p n="3">3 A Biſhop, if you conſider him meerly as a Biſhop, was but <hi>a Miniſter,</hi> and ſet apart to doe the worke of <hi>a Miniſter,</hi> the ſame, which all other Miniſters may doe; Biſhops did <hi>Pray, Preach, Baptize, adminiſter the Lords Supper, Ordaine, Suſpend, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate,</hi> and theſe things other Miniſters doe, and may doe; that he did lift up himſelfe above other Miniſters, that was his errour, that he would take upon him the ſole power of <hi>Ordination,</hi> and <hi>Excommunication,</hi> this was his errour; but as the addition of an human invention did not null the Ordinances, (as ſuppoſe only growne perſons had been baptized, and that by dipping, and after dipping they had been ſigned with the ſigne of the Croſſe, would this have nulled the Ordinance in the Anabaptiſts eſteeme?) no more this uſurpation of the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of adminiſtring theſe Ordinances did null a Biſhop, ſo as he was no Miniſter; the Ordinances were, and are Chriſts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions.

How to mend Dr. <hi>Seamans</hi> Divinity I know not, where you have alſo the errour acknowledged implicitely (for it is in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to this Objection) then giving his judgement in the caſe: <hi>When ſinne cleaves to the manner of Calling,

            <p n="6">6 There is a maxime taken up among the Independents,
<note place="margin">Many may truly beare the name, yea they owne it, and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly.</note> (yea and others) and it goeth for as good Divinity as any the Goſpel hath, viz. <hi>That errours in Non-fundamentals muſt be borne withall in Churches, we muſt labour indeed to convince people of ſuch, but if they will not be ſo convinced, we muſt not proceed any further to caſt them out.</hi> I have heard the <hi>New England</hi> Miniſters ſharply cenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, becauſe they have excommunicated for ſome errours, (<hi>i.e.</hi> denying of ſome Ordinances) which are ſuppoſed to fall with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the compaſſe of Non-fundamentals; This maxime is cryed up among the Separatiſts. For the Theſis it ſelfe (conſidering into what a narrow compaſſe <hi>Fundamentals</hi> are pent up) I thinke it to be <hi>Apocryphall Divinity,</hi> and juſt it is with God to let in errours in Fundamentals, when ſuch Church, and Truth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtructive Principles are drunke in by godly Chriſtians; yet let us bring this rule, and lay it to the caſe in hand: I hope they doe not make rules for themſelves, if it be a true Chriſtian Rule, it is for all Chriſtians; Here then we have men qualified by God with Miniſteriall, and (abundance of them) perſonal gifts, they have the election or conſent of the people, they are ſeparated to the worke of the Miniſtry by perſons, who were Miniſters, but did erroneouſly aſſume too much to themſelves, now grant that here is an errour, yet I hope it is not in a fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall point. Some great Divines call Ordination but an Adjunct, and your ſelves leſſe, you thinke it a Toy: ſo then if you muſt not be <hi>ſeparated</hi> from a Church for errours in Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fundamentals, then neither ought you to <hi>ſeparate</hi> from a true Church for an errour, which is not fundamentall. Certainly if that rule hath place any where, then here: you will by this rule keepe Anabaptiſts, Anti-Sabbatarians, Antinomians, (truly ſuch) Anti-Pſalmiſts, Arminians, &amp;c. within your Churches, and not caſt them out; but (forſooth) a little errour (in compariſon of them) and that <hi>acknowledged,</hi> in the Miniſters, that is ground ſufficient to caſt off them, and call them Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtians, &amp;c. yet there are no conſcientious men but theſe; the Separatiſts Goſpel will afford Rules for them, but not for other Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>As you trouble the Miniſters here, ſo I doubt they will
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:117994:19"/>trouble you in the Ordinations of your Miniſters; that is, to make it cleare to them, that <hi>private</hi> men have power to Ordaine: I have ſeene it my ſelfe, when two private men have impoſed their hands upon him, who was to be their Paſtor. Another I know, whom a Carpenter and a Taylor Ordained, with impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of hands; I doubt the Miniſters will put you hard to it, to prove that this is according to the Rule, (yea, when other Miniſters [but of other Churches] were preſent, theſe have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed hands.) If we conſult with the Goſpel, we ſhall finde it rather to favour a Biſhop (though no Lordly one) by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> (from whom our Biſhops proved their Superiority, and ſole power of Ordination) to Ordaine, then private men, and that in the preſence of divers other Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters. I am ſure this will be hard to prove from Scripture, I ſhall ſpeake a few words to this point afterward. Suppoſe any of the Biſhops had been of that opinion, that none but perſons growne, and making confeſſion of their Faith ought to be Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, and they would Baptize only by dipping, would not the Anabaptiſts have judged this to be true Baptiſme? would they null this Baptiſme, becauſe he was a Biſhop, ſince he was a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, ſet apart to that worke? &amp;c. as <hi>Auſtin</hi> baptized many thus, after he had been in <hi>England</hi> a while, who yet was an <hi>Arch-Biſhop,</hi> was that no true Baptiſme? I doe not thinke that the Anabaptiſts (if they have any braines in their heads) will deny that Baptiſme were nul; if that were good, ſo is Ordination for the ſubſtance of it. If there have been no true <hi>Miniſters,</hi> nor <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances,</hi> nor <hi>Churches,</hi> but where there hath been no humane mixtures, nor wicked perſons, then there hath been but few <hi>Miniſters, Ordinances,</hi> or <hi>Churches,</hi> ſince there was a Church up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on earth, and if there ought to be ſeparation from ſuch Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and Churches, then we ſhould have found Separatiſts e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough; how hardly was Superſtition kept out in the Church of the <hi>Jewes</hi> before the Captivity, ſay, how many yeares?

After Chriſt, I pray tell me, how long did the Churches continue without Superſtitious mixtures, I doubt you will finde the Church hath not been long free, but we doe not finde ſeparation preſently, and nulling of Miniſters, as now Men ſhould doe well to give us a precept, or example out of the Word, where Ordinances have been diſpenſed true for the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, though ſome humane mixtures have been joyned to them, that therefore they were iterated. If they cannot give us a direct precept or example, ſhew us it by a neceſſary conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence from Scripture.

            <p n="9">9 There are hundreds of Miniſters in <hi>England,</hi> who were not Ordained by Biſhops, but you ſeparate from thoſe alſo; they had the election of the people firſt, then with faſting and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, ſolemnly ſet apart to the worke by divers godly and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Divines, who were againſt Biſhops, yet theſe are alſo ſcor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by your ſelves, as much as the others; but (forſooth) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were Ordained by Biſhops, and had not renounced their Ordination, and taken their Ordination from you, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that infection ſpreads even to all Generations. Out of what I have ſaid, I may pick up ſome anſwers to this, but for troubling the Reader; and the truth is, they are in ſome ſence unreaſonable men I deale with; but this let me ſay, it is ſtrange, that when an Ordinance is purged in it ſelfe, and thoſe who ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter it, renounce what defects have cleaved to their owne Ordination, only for the ſubſtance owning it (as another <hi>Ordinance</hi> may be corrupted, or rather have corruptions annexed to it, but not nulled by thoſe accidentall corruptions) that this infecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſhould adhere ſo ſtrongly, that it cannot be mended, but by nulling of it. Friends, this cavilling will not doe in the Day of Judgement. Beſides, I pray give me an inſtance where it was ever practiſed, that perſons, that were not Baptiſed, did Ordaine a Miniſter? If you aske me, What need that queſtion, for we are Baptiſed, therefore it doth not concerne us? By whom I
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:117994:20"/>pray? If you ſay, by the Miniſters, then I deſire no more; if they were ſo farre Miniſters as to adminiſter Baptiſme to you, then they may well adminiſter Ordination to us; renounce therefore the Baptiſme you had by them, ſo I am ſure you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ordaine; and when you are regularly re-baptiſed, and can warrant your Act, and prove that you have the power to Ordaine, then we will liſten to you.</p>
            <p>For my owne Ordination, it was in the face of my people, the day was ſpent in faſting, and Prayer, thoſe who carried on the worke were Mr. <hi>Dan. Rogers,</hi> Mr. <hi>Marſhall,</hi> Mr. <hi>Ranew,</hi> with other godly Miniſters, who joyned with them in the impoſing of hands (the Miniſters lived about me) I never ſaw that Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance carried on with more ſolemnity in my life, the people ſhewed their election by ſuffrage, holding up their hands; all was done according to the Pattern; but yet I am a man as much ſcorned as other men, who were Ordained by Biſhops. (I can ſubmit to God in that ſcorne that theſe caſt upon me, for I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it at his hands;) only there was a foule errour commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at my Ordination, and it is told up and downe by ſome of this kinde, againſt whom I write, and I pray what is it?

            <p n="4">4 If you obſerve the examples in the New Teſtament, which are our Guides in Church affaires, we ſhall finde Ordinations have been thus performed; as <hi>Acts</hi> 6.6. <hi>Act.</hi> 13.3. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.14. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.22. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.2. <hi>Laying on of hands;</hi> Which place, by Claſſicall men, Congregationall men, and Separatiſts, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted of Ordination.

            <p>The ſubſtance and eſſence then of Ordination being this, <hi>That perſons qualified Miniſterially be ſet apart, or ſeparated for the worke of the Miniſtry by perſons in Office</hi> [ordinarily it muſt be thus, what may be done extraordinarily, when no Officers can be had is another caſe] the Miniſters in <hi>England</hi> have that Ordinance for the ſubſtance, and they have the election and conſent of the people, (it is hardly to be ſuppoſed that every individuall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in a Pariſh will conſent to every godly Miniſter, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent there is) hence theſe two concurring to the <hi>Call,</hi> which is the <hi>forme</hi> of a Miniſter, many Presbyteriall Miniſters are true Miniſters. I dare ſay more, but I am ſure now I ſave my ſelfe. But I have not done with Ordination yet, I ſhall meet with it once againe afterwards. Let us now come and try the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond ground for ſeparation, <hi>ſcil. The Worſhip of God;</hi> the fault here muſt be reduced to one of theſe three heads; ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;</p>
            <p n="1">1 Becauſe they cannot enjoy all the Ordinances of God in theſe Churches. Or,</p>
            <p n="2">2 Becauſe the Ordinances of God are mixed with humane inventions, that they cannot partake of them without ſinne. Or,</p>
            <p n="3">3 Becauſe here are other Ordinances ſet up in the Churches then ever Chriſt did inſtitute. I cannot conceive any more.</p>
            <p>For the firſt; Suppoſe it were ſo, that there were a defect of ſome Ordinances, is that a ſufficient ground for ſeparation? Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> ſaith no. If a Father of a Family wants a Rod in his houſe,
<note place="margin">The pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face to Survey of Church Diſcip.</note> is it <hi>ergo</hi> no family? there may be ſome diſorder in the houſe for want of good Government, yet a family. Divers Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines of great note conceive by that text, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 8.17, 18. That the Church of the <hi>Jewes</hi> did omit the celebration of the Feaſt of Tabernacles almoſt the ſpace of a thouſand yeares, the Arke was abſent from the Tabernacle from the time of <hi>Eli,</hi> to the time of <hi>David,</hi> 1 Sam. 4.11. compared with, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6, 17. and it was a great fault; the Scribes rejected the Baptiſme of <hi>John,</hi>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:117994:21"/>but where doe you finde any ſeparation all this while, that the godly ſhould not joyne with that Church, and partake in what Ordinances they had? But this objection hath no place in theſe Churches, for <hi>Prayer, Preaching, Administration</hi> of the <hi>Sacraments,</hi> yea, <hi>Diſcipline</hi> they had in the Epiſcopall dayes, they did ſuſpend from the Lords Supper, and the Biſhops gave the Miniſters power, but ſuſpenſion is the <hi>leſſer Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and now to be ſure there are none wanting (at leaſt ſhould not be,) if the Miniſters were not hindred in ſetting up all the Ordinances.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> No, ſay you, the Claſſicall Churches have no explicite Covenant for the forme of them, they will not admit it into their Churches, therefore we ſeparate.</p>
            <p>I ſhal meet with this in another place, only for the preſent diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove what Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> hath ſaid, and the former examples I have given you; but yet you will have a hard peece of work, to prove this to be a ſufficient ground for your ſeparation, as af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards I hope I ſhall make good.</p>
            <p>For the ſecond, <hi>Humane mixtures in Ordinances.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This indeed was the ground of the old Separatiſts, yet in thoſe dayes many holy and learned Divines wrote againſt the Separation; but in theſe dayes that ſtumbling blocke is remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; and this let me ſay, that if you read over all the Church-ſtories, ſince there was a Church upon the earth, there cannot be found any example of ſuch ſeparatiſts, as are now amongſt us; the old <hi>Donatiſts</hi> had their Miniſters, yea, <hi>Biſhops</hi> as well as <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters;</hi> the ſeparate Churches of later dayes had their Miniſters, and how ſtrictly did they maintaine and practiſe all thoſe Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, which ours laugh at, as <hi>ſinging</hi> of <hi>Pſalmes, Infant-Baptiſm,</hi> obſervation of the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> and ſuch opinions as thoſe learned and godly men, Mr. <hi>Ainſworth, Robinſon, Johnſon,</hi> did abhorre, are ſwallowed downe among ours; ſo that theſe men cannot ground their practice from any example heretofore; and as for the <hi>Scripture,</hi> if they can finde any grounds there, I muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe I am altogether ignorant in the Scripture.</p>
            <p>Suppoſe there ſhould be ſome human mixtures (though for my part I know of none) are all the Ordinances ſo polluted: prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching and prayer were kept pure in the Epiſcopall dayes; why doe you not communicate with them in thoſe Ordinances, which are pure?</p>
            <pb n="30" facs="tcp:117994:22"/>
            <p>If you object, <hi>The Ordinances indeed are pure, but thoſe who joyne in thoſe Ordinances are not pure, therefore we ſeparate.</hi>

            <p>This properly belongs to the third head (the <hi>Congregation</hi>) I ſhall there anſwer to this Cavill.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, for the ſetting up ſuch Ordinances as Chriſt never did, I cannot imagine where you will be, unleſſe you meane <hi>Infant-baptiſme,</hi> and <hi>ſinging of Pſalmes,</hi> for I finde theſe are ſpoken againſt very much. But are theſe fundamental errors, if they bee errours, have you beene forced to baptiſe your Infants, or ſing Pſalmes? are you not at your choice whether you will or not? do not many people ſit in Congregations, and not ſing at all? not but that I conceive Church-members ought to be regarded in this, and called to an account, though they had need be hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led tenderly, if otherwiſe they ſeeme to be godly, yet their being hopefully godly, is not a ſufficient ground to keep them from Church-cenſures, unleſſe all circumſtances being confide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red they appeare to be truly conſcientious, men of humble ſpirits, not ſelfe-willed, and deſiring forbearance and patience in clearing of the point, then I know Miniſters would beare with ſuch a long time; but to have perſons runne into theſe errours, and let alone, as if they were things of no concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; truly by what rules you will looſe <hi>two</hi> Ordinances, you may looſe <hi>foure;</hi> Officiall preaching is cryed downe, and Church Diſcipline alſo, by the <hi>Eraſtians,</hi> no outward forme of Government, which I ſuppoſe was the ſcope of Mr. <hi>Dells</hi> Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon before the <hi>Parliament;</hi> and ſo I thinke it is that which <hi>Rob. Purnell</hi> in his ſhort Propheſie of the down-fall of <hi>Presbytery</hi> and <hi>Independency</hi> aimes at, that there ſhould be no externall forme of Church-Government, but only the government of the ſpirit within; and for all Ordinances, ſome are above them, who have been Members of Congregationall Churches, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that when the Brethren came to chuſe an Officer, a <hi>Maſon</hi> roſe up and oppoſed it, profeſſing he lived immediatly upon Chriſt, and he owned none; neither was he alone I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve: but if you take away all the Ordinances, how we ſhall know there is a <hi>God</hi> in the world, I know not; to be ſure, we ſhall not know by the dealings of theſe men: I know ſo much by them, that one had as good deale with the <hi>Indians</hi> as with ſome of them, ſo that in concluſion we ſhall have brave Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches without ordinances.</p>
            <pb n="31" facs="tcp:117994:22"/>
            <p>As for <hi>Infant-baptiſme,</hi> this is not a place for me to prove it to be an Ordinance of God; what the Adverſaries can ſay is ſummed up in Mr. <hi>Tombes,</hi> a man, I heare, eſteemed truly godly on all hands, and for his Learning he ſhewes himſelfe to be a Schollar, it is pitty the mans parts were defiled in maintaining ſuch a <hi>wretched opinion,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> calls it. I confeſſe, Maſter <hi>Tombes's</hi> abilities are ſuch, that I may hold the Candle to him, but yet let me ſay this, I can eaſily diſcerne Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute more like a <hi>Sophiſter,</hi> then a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> that did deſire to ſee truth. Mr. <hi>Marſhall</hi> tells him, and not without cauſe,
<note place="margin">In his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, &amp;c. p. 247.</note> 
               <hi>Your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty is farre better in darkening, ſlurring, and plundering the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of your Adverſarie, then in making good your owne.</hi> It is the happineſſe Mr. <hi>Marſhall</hi> hath above many, that in his preaching, and ſo in printing, he can convey his minde to his Hearer, or Reader ſo, as the weakeſt may underſtand; how then his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments come to be ſo darke, to ſo learned a man, as Mr. <hi>Tombes,</hi> I cannot conceive, if he had dealt candidly; but when Maſter <hi>Tombes</hi> hath anſwered Mr. <hi>Marſhall, Cotton, Baxter, Cobbet, Hooker, Holmes, Geree,</hi> &amp;c. then we ſhall bethinke our ſelves of new Arguments, but theſe Worthies have maintained that Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance with that ſtrength, that I beleeve the contrary opinion will rarely, or never take with an intelligent head, and a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, godly heart.</p>
            <p>For <hi>ſinging of Pſalmes,</hi> this is not a place neither to follow that Queſtion: whether it be an Ordinance of God, I never heard of any that writ againſt it, except one, whom Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> hath anſwered, and I thinke ſufficiently enough. When Maſter <hi>Cotton</hi> is ſilenced, then we ſhall bethinke our ſelves concerning that Ordinance: I heare of others that have printed for it, but Maſter <hi>Cottons</hi> peece is all I have ſeene concerning that ſubject, <hi>Pro</hi> or <hi>con.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Only becauſe there was a <hi>Sectary,</hi>
               <note place="margin">In <hi>Colche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter.</hi>
               </note> that in a Shop ſcoffingly asked me, To what purpoſe ſinging of Pſalmes was? the mans ſpirit I ſaw very unſavoury, and the place not convenient to diſcourſe; I gave him no anſwer, but ſhall now give him the grounds that lead me to beleeve it is an Ordinance of Chriſt, and let him confute them. I cannot avoyd it, but I muſt touch divers things that have been touched before, but what I doe, ſhall be very briefe.</p>
            <p n="1">1. If ſinging of Pſalmes were an Ordinance under the Old
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:117994:23"/>Teſtament, and not repealed in the New Teſtament [being not Typicall, or Ceremoniall, &amp;c.] then it is alſo an Ordinance under the New Teſtament.</p>
            <p>But the Antecedent is true, <hi>ergo</hi> the Conſequent is true.</p>
            <p>For the Antecedent, that it was an ordinance then, the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries deny not, and as other ordinances, which then were in uſe, and not repealed (as Prayer, Preaching, &amp;c.) are ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances now under the New Teſtament, why ſhould not ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Pſalmes alſo be continued an ordinance ſtill?</p>
            <p>They object, <hi>Singing of Pſalmes with the voyce, is but a type of ſinging Pſalmes with the heart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I anſwer; If indeed it were <hi>typicall,</hi> then it were ſome ground to beleeve it was repealed; we read your Dictates, but we read no proofes, give us your texts to prove it was typicall, elſe your Dictates will not take with us; That which makes me ſtrongly to beleeve the contrary is this, That <hi>Paul,</hi> and <hi>Silas,</hi> when none but they were in the Priſon, yet they ſang, <hi>Act.</hi> 16.25. now this was ill done of them, if it were Typicall, yet to keep it in practiſe, when they were alone, however in other points and Ceremonies the Apoſtles did condeſcend as farre as they could to the <hi>Jewes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Epia. 19.</note> giving the Ceremonies (being now dead) as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, an honourable buriall, yet that <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> being now alone without <hi>Jewes,</hi> having no ſuch temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, but may keep their liberty, ſhould practiſe a Typicall ordinance, beleeve it who will, for I cannot. When I had fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med my anſwer, looking into Mr. <hi>Cotton,</hi> I perceived that he mentions this of their ſinging in anſwer to this Cavill,
<note place="margin">P. 24.</note> and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth more anſwers, whither I referre the Reader.</p>
            <p n="2">2 The ſecond ground that moves me is the expreſſe Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.19. &amp; <hi>Col.</hi> 3.16. ſpeaking one to another in Pſalmes, <gap reason="foreign">

            </p>
            <p>Severall Objections are here made, which I ſhall not ſtudy to anſwer, only in a word.</p>
            <pb n="33" facs="tcp:117994:23"/>
            <p n="1">1 They ſay, <hi>The text doth not ſay, ſing one to another, but ſpeake one to another; the Pſalmes dwelling in their hearts, they were to diſpenſe them in way of teaching; but as for ſinging, he maketh no mention of that untill he came to teach them, the manner of diſpenſing the Word of Chriſt</hi> [<hi>a</hi> darke expreſſion] <hi>unto God in the end of the verſe, and that is making melody in the heart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Maſter <hi>Cotton</hi> anſwers with a grave reproofe; <q>That men ſhould rather bow their judgements and practiſes to Scripture Language, then bow the ſence of the Scripture to their owne conceptions againſt the Language of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; for ſaith he, it is one thing to ſpeake one to another <hi>in</hi> Pſalmes, and Hymnes, and ſpirituall Songs, as is done in ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and another thing to teach one another <hi>out</hi> of Pſalms, &amp;c. It is true, they were to teach one another out of the Pſalmes, and the ſcope of <hi>Paul</hi> will reach that; but if he had meant only ſo, he would not have ſaid, Speake yee one to another, <hi>In</hi> Pſalmes, but <hi>Out</hi> of the Pſalmes, as is the Scripture phraſe, &amp;c.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2 To me it ſeemeth ſtrange, if that were all <hi>Pauls</hi> meaning, why ſhould <hi>Paul</hi> mention only thoſe parts of the Word which uſe to be ſung? Why doth he not mention the Prophets, <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> &amp;c. as alſo the New Teſtament, to teach one another out of them? Are there not as excellent Truths, gracious Promiſes, to be found in thoſe Prophets, and worthy for Chriſtians to be inſtructed in, as in the Pſalmes, or other Songs that we finde of <hi>Moſes, Deborah,</hi> &amp;c? but for <hi>Iſaiah, Jeremiah,</hi> and all thoſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, beſides other parts of the Old and New Teſtament, they were never wont to be ſung in the Church, but only theſe which <hi>Paul</hi> mentions in both places, not adding any portion of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture more in the Epiſt. to the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> then to the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> therefore I cannot beleeve that ſhould be the meaning, as the <hi>Objector</hi> ſaith.</p>
            <p n="3">3 The Apoſtle mentions <hi>ſinging</hi> we ſee preſently, now if any thing can be made out of what the Objector ſaith, it may poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly be this; That <hi>Paul</hi> would have them teach one another the ſence and ſcope of a Pſalme, that all may underſtand the meaning of the Pſalme they ſing [as is the practiſe of ſome Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, if they be to ſing a Pſalme that is more darke, then in a few words they give the people to underſtand the meaning of the Pſalme they ſing] and <hi>ſo ſing with underſtanding,</hi> 1 Cor. 14, 15. I ſay, Why may not this be ſomething of the meaning? I leave
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:117994:24"/>it to more able heads to judge. But this doth not exclude ſinging</p>
            <p>But whereas he conceives <hi>ſinging</hi> ſhould be only <hi>the making melody in the heart,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hieron, in <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 3. <hi>Nuſquam legimus aliquem ſine voce cantaſſe, unde neceſse eſt hic, in corde, ex corde, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligi, &amp;c.</hi>
               </note> I pray let him heare what an old Commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor ſaid long agoe, upon the words; <hi>We read no where that any one ſung without a voyce, wherefore it is neceſſary that in the Heart here, he underſtood from the Heart. viz.

            <p>The ſame text alſo affords a good ground for ſinging <hi>Davids</hi> Pſalmes, with other ſpirituall Songs recorded in Scripture; or elſe I deſire them to give me a reaſon, why <hi>Paul</hi> ſhould direct us to the very Titles of <hi>Davids</hi> Pſalmes, and yet not meane <hi>Davids</hi> Pſalmes, any one that hath the leaſt taſte of the Hebrew Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage knowes this.

            <p>The third ground that moves me, is the example I finde in the New Teſtament, of Chriſt himſelfe, with his Apoſtles, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.30. they ſung a Hymne; he did not ſing it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Paſſeover and the inſtitution of the Supper, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Typicall thing, and ſo let it be joyned to the Paſſeover, as the <hi>Jewes</hi> did; but after he had inſtituted that Ordinance, which muſt laſt to the end of the world, and they received the Bread and Wine, then he and they ſung, as ſome conceive ſix Pſalmes,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Beza</hi> in Loc.</note> beginning at 112. to 117. whence it is the practiſe of Churches, following the patterne, to ſing after the receiving of the Supper.</p>
            <p>So the example of <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas,</hi> Act. 16, 25. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>Hym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nos canebant Deo,</hi> ſaith <hi>Beza,</hi> or <hi>Hymnis laudabant Deum,</hi> Piſcator, and <hi>Paſor,</hi> they praiſed God with Hymnes; that which ſome object, the text ſaith, <hi>they ſang praiſes,</hi> not <hi>Pſalmes;</hi> this is very poore, beſides the originall word, how ſhould one ſing praiſes to God but in ſome Pſalme, ſpirituall Sons, &amp;c. for <hi>Praiſe,</hi> if
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:117994:24"/>you take it properly as diſtinct from <hi>honour</hi> and <hi>glory,</hi> is but <hi>the honourable making mention of another, and that externally by tongue or pen;</hi> alſo that text, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.15. by <hi>him therefore let us offer the ſacrifice of praiſe to God continually, that is, the fruit of our lips, &amp;c.</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timates as much.</p>
            <p>And this text over-throws that conceit of ſinging only in the heart, which one that was a member of the Church of <hi>Rowly</hi> in <hi>New England</hi> had taken up, and upon that ground, and ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther notions he had, denied ſinging, and maintained (as well as he could) that ſinging of Pſalmes was no Ordinance of God. <hi>I</hi> doe not know how this mans opinion came to be knowne, for had he kept his owne counſell, I ſuppoſe none ſhould much have taken notice of him, which makes me thinke it was of his owne venting at firſt; our Elders laboured with him to convince him (the Elders of <hi>Ipſwich,</hi> beſides his owne Paſtor) this text was alledged to prove ſinging with an <hi>Audible voyce,</hi> for they ſang, and the Priſoners heard him: yet this man could not [or rather would not, for the thing is plaine as any one may underſtand] be convinced of the thing; the man af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter long labouring with him, but to no purpoſe, for he was te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacious in his owne opinion, and as <hi>Hieron.</hi> ſaid of <hi>Jovinianus, Non eſt contentus noſtro,</hi> i. e. <hi>humano more loqui, altius quiddam aggre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditur; High flowne in his notions.</hi> The Elders ſeeing that obſtinacy was joyned to his errour, they concluded, that either they muſt <hi>caſt that Ordinance out of the Church,</hi> or <hi>elſe caſt him out of the Church,</hi> and ſo the Church of <hi>Rowley</hi> did caſt him out. I know they have been cenſured for this Act by ſome here, but at the Day of Judgement they will give as comfortable an account for maintaining of the Ordinances of Chriſt, as they ſhall doe, who through their maxime of <hi>errours in Non-fundamentalls,</hi> make way to looſe all the Ordinances, and then where is the Church?</p>
            <p>From this example of <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> we may argue, if <hi>two</hi> may ſing Hymnes or Pſalmes together, then <hi>foure</hi> may, ſo <hi>forty,</hi> the number hinders not, for the voyces here of many are no hinderance to the Ordinance, but rather they help to ſtirre up the affections one of another; as in thoſe, who are filled with wine, two ſinging together, or foure, doe not hinder their conceited mirth. So Chriſt and his eleven Apoſtles ſang together.</p>
            <p>Whether will theſe men allow one Chriſtian to ſing a Pſalme
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:117994:25"/>alone by himſelfe, methinkes the texts and examples mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, together with <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.13. <hi>Is any man merry,</hi>

               <hi>let him ſing Pſalmes,</hi> are ſo plaine, as no rationall man can deny it; But if <hi>one</hi> may, then the <hi>Church</hi> may. There is no act of Worſhip which any member of the Church is bound to performe, but the Church is bound to performe; but on the contrary it is not true, that what worſhip the Church doth performe, a member of Church can, or may; for inſtance for the firſt part, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation needs no Organ of the body, and therefore I leave that. But doth a Member of the Church <hi>Pray,</hi> ſo doth the whole Church: doth <hi>he read the Scriptures?</hi> ſo they are read in the Church; doth he <hi>faſt</hi> and <hi>pray?</hi> ſo doth the Church; doth he <hi>ſing a Pſalme?</hi> ſo doth the Church; but it is not true on the contrary, as appeares in the Sacraments, Preaching, Diſcipline, &amp;c. Neither is that place, <hi>Revel.</hi> 15.2, 3. of ſmall force, to prove ſinging to be an Ordinance,

            <p n="4">4 The fourth ground that moves me is this [I know not how it will take with others, but with me it is ſomething] <hi>Pſal</hi> 92. The title ſaith, it is <hi>a Pſalme, or Song for the day of Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath;</hi> it is cleare, that one way of ſanctification of the Sabbath was by ſinging of Pſalmes; two of the words that <hi>Paul</hi> uſes in <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.19. are in this Title <gap reason="foreign">

               <hi>Pſalme, Spirituall Songs;</hi> will any ſay, this Pſalme was only for thoſe times, but now is aboliſhed with the Jewiſh Sabbath? what, is that admirable promiſe, in the thirteenth, and fourteenth verſes vaniſhed, and of no uſe to us? Should not Chriſtians apply it, and plead it now, when as they are planted in Gods houſe, and attending on him on our Chriſtian Sabbath? have not we as much need of the Promiſe as they? this with me hath much prevailed; if we owne a Chriſtian Sabbath, ſinging of Pſalmes may well be owned alſo for an Ordinance of God now, as well as then.</p>
            <p n="5">5 The fifth is the preſence of the Spirit of God with his people in the uſe of this Ordinance; for the proofe of what I ſay, let thouſands of Gods people ſpeake, if they have not found God in the Ordinance; I will not goe ſo farre as <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtin,</hi>

            <p n="6">6 The laſt ground that moves me, is the practiſe of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Churches: Antiquity after Scripture is as a Cypher after a Figure, and doth increaſe the number; that ſinging was fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent among thoſe Chriſtians I finde it recorded.</p>

            <p>So that in the Apoſtles times, and the ages next to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, we finde ſinging was in uſe.</p>

            <pb n="39" facs="tcp:117994:26"/>
            <p>As for thoſe, who would allow ſinging, if it might be of ſome <hi>ſpirituall ſong</hi> compoſed by ſome <hi>Saint</hi> now upon ſome occaſions, I doe not now trouble my ſelfe about them, onely I wiſh them to make better ſongs, then that <hi>brother</hi> of one of the Churches in <hi>London</hi> [I doe forbeare to name whoſe Church it was] who compoſed a ſong to be ſung on the <hi>day of Thanksgiving</hi> for the overthrow of the <hi>Scots</hi> at <hi>Dunbar;</hi> I heard the Song read over, and the party who read it, told me it was ſung in the Church: I deny not but the man who compoſed it, might have an <hi>honeſt heart,</hi> but ſure he had but a <hi>ſhallow head,</hi> in compariſon of what men ſhould have, that compoſe ſuch Songs.</p>

            <p>So much for the ſecond branch, the <hi>worſhip</hi> can be no ground of ſeparation. Now I come to the third.</p>
            <p>Let us ſee if there be ſufficient ground for ſeparation in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the <hi>Congregation.</hi> The Congregations <hi>are very corrupt they ſay, hence they thinke they are bound to ſeparate,</hi> and alleadge theſe places, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.17. <hi>Revel.</hi> 18.4.</p>

<note place="margin">See him alſo p. 202</note> the fault is not in them, but in the old <hi>Hierar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy,</hi> whoſe Errours while they goe about to mend, you goe away from them.</p>
            <p n="2">2.

            <p n="3">3. I wiſh you would give us precept or example, where there have beene Churches with ſo many viſible Saints, and ſuch Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, and theſe Miniſters deſiring and labouring to reforme as they doe, and yet that Chriſtians have done, or ſhould ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from them. Thoſe Texts above mentioned, and often al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged, if you pleaſe to view them well againe, are very far from proving it: Corrupt members there were enough in the Jewiſh Church, and ſo in the Chriſtian Churches ſoone after, and in the Apoſtles times; but you have no example of ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating from them, but in them, ſay the <hi>London</hi> Miniſters, we doe ſeparate,</p>

            <p>But for Prayer, why would not you have them joyne in prayer? when as,</p>
            <p>Firſt, Prayer is a part of naturall worſhip, the light of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture dictates this to every man, if he owne a God, then pray unto him, <hi>Jonah</hi> 1.6. <hi>Call upon thy God,</hi> &amp;c. but I hope none in your Congregations, but owne even the true God, therefore they are bound to pray to him.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Peter</hi> when he ſaw <hi>Simon, Act.</hi> 8.22. in the very gall of bitterneſſe, yet bid him, <hi>Pray God:</hi> Then worſt of men may pray.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Prayer God hath uſed to be a converting Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance; I have knowne one my ſelfe that now is in heaven, but was at firſt a notorious wretch', a mock-God, Captaine of
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:117994:27"/>Drunkards, who coming into the Church as the Miniſter was in prayer, God brake his heart, and followed it on ſo, as he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came an eminent Saint.</p>
            <p>Object. <hi>They mixe with us in our ſinging, mixed worſhip we cannot joyne in.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I cannot conceive what harm this can do to you; is the mixing of your owne corruption in your ſervice leſſe prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall to the acceptance of it with God, then the preſence of wicked men joyning in the ſervice?</p>
            <p>If indeed you can prove to me that God will not have wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men ſing, but if they doe, he will not accept of the ſervice of his people, this is ſome ground for your exception; but I conceive you will not be able to prove the former, much leſſe the latter.</p>
            <p>That wicked men may ſing, I prove thus:</p>
            <p>Firſt, If wicked men may pray unto God (as the light of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture teaches) then they may praiſe God; the light of nature teaches this alſo: nature teaches me to pray to God for what I want, and nature teaches me to praiſe God for what I receive. If then na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall men may praiſe God with their mouths [for praiſe muſt bee expreſſed with tongue or pen, if you take it properly, as I ſaid before] why not by ſinging? God hath given this gift to them, as well as to others. But that to praiſe God is a part of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall worſhip, and belongs to all men, we may conceive by the example of the Philiſtims, <hi>Judg.</hi> 16.23. <hi>They met to offer a great ſacrifice to Dagon, and to rejoyce</hi> (becauſe of <hi>Sampſon.</hi>) Here is a day of Thankſgiving; ſo 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 10.9. becauſe <hi>Saul</hi> was ſlaine, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>If we goe to the <hi>Romans,</hi> we ſhall finde nature had taught them to ſing to their feigned gods,
<note place="margin">Godw. Rom. Ant. l. 2. ſ. 2. c. 19</note> not to tranſcribe their rites in their ſacrifices, <hi>After the portion layed out for the gods had beene burnt, then did all the people repaire to a common feaſt; where, as they were eating, they ſung hymnes and ſongs in the praiſe of their gods, and playing on Cymbals, they danced about the Altars, intimating thereby, that there was no part of their body, but ſhould be imployed in the ſervice of their gods, &amp;c.</hi> If nature taught the <hi>Romans</hi> to ſing hymnes and ſongs to their feigned and fooliſh gods, why ſhould wicked men be debarred from ſinging to the true God?</p>
            <p n="2">2. We finde <hi>Exod.</hi> 15.1. <hi>Moſes</hi> and the ſonnes of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> ſang a ſong to the Lord, in <hi>v.</hi> 12. <hi>Miriam</hi> bids the women ſing; I doubt not but among theſe ſonnes and daughters of <hi>Iſrael,</hi>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:117994:28"/>there were perſons as corrupt as any in our Congregations: then the preſence of wicked men doe not ſo defile you, or the Ordinance, as is ſuppoſed; to themſelves indeed it was polluted, as are all other things, but this hindred not <hi>Moſes,</hi> nor <hi>Miriam,</hi> they did not ſeparate all thoſe, who were godly, from the reſt, and ſing onely with them; I doubt they ſhould have had but few ſongſters.</p>
            <p n="3">3. May a wicked man read a Pſalme, or one of thoſe ſongs? give me a reaſon why not? Will you debarre a wicked man from reading the word? If he may read a Pſalme, why may not he ſing the Pſalme? To read the word is worſhip, ſo to ſing the Pſalme is worſhip: It is true, he cannot ſing as hee ſhould, no more he cannot read the Pſalme as he ſhould, nor heare, &amp;c. therefore he muſt not read nor heare the word: To ſing, is we ſee taught by the light of nature, as well as the other, to pray, read, or heare the word. This Ordinance is not, as the Sacraments, which we doe not ſee ſo by natures light, but have them by divine Inſtitution revealed, having alſo a ſealing na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture annexed to them.</p>
            <p n="4">4. We finde the word calling upon all ſorts of perſons to praiſe God, Pſal. 96.1. <hi>Sing unto the Lord all the earth,</hi> Pſal. 68.32. <hi>Sing unto the Lord all the Kingdomes of the earth,</hi> &amp;c. Severall ſuch texts we finde.</p>
            <p>I might adde more Arguments, and anſwer to ſome objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but I content my ſelfe with theſe.</p>
            <p>Object. <hi>But they mixe with us in the Lords Supper.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> That the preſence of others defile you [eſpecially if you have done your duty to keepe that Ordinance cleare] is a thing that our Congregational men utterly deny; thoſe who are acquainted with their workes, may ſee it often mentioned, therefore I quote none.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I wil be bold to ſay there are many Presbyterial Miniſters, who have as few wicked men, at that Ordinance, as were in the Church of <hi>Corinth.</hi> There were more matters of exception in that Church for the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, then are in abundance of theſe Churches; beſides, you ſee what courſe they did take to keep that Ordinance clear, and when they could not obtain what they deſired of the Civil power, yet they reſolved to goe further, which gave Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> occaſion to write againſt them.</p>
            <pb n="43" facs="tcp:117994:28"/>
            <p n="3">3. I doubt if we examine things well, your ſelves are moſt to blame in that for which you ſeparate. Suppoſe you be in a Congregationall Church, and have all things, as you deſire; if there be any perſon there, who falls ſcandalouſly, that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves to be ſuſpended from the Ordinance, I pray tell me, what method will you take? I am ſure the method is this, <hi>If thy Brother offend, tell him, if he heare thee not, take two, if not, tell the Church, Matth.</hi> 18. What ſhall the Miniſter alone ſuſpend him [it may be he knows not of it] when no Witneſſe comes in againſt him? No ſure; yea, ſuppoſe a Miniſter ſaw a man drunke, one of his Members, and none ſaw him, or knew it but himſelfe; he deales indeed with this Member, but the man denyeth it, he ſaid he was not; the Miniſter is ſure he was drunke but wants witneſſe; the man comes to the Supper [denying the thing though the Miniſter had wiſhed him privately to forbeare] ſhall the Miniſter now debarre him? No ſure, the text laies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother method, the Miniſter muſt not be the <hi>ſole Witneſſe and Judge</hi> too; For if Miniſters may debarre upon their own heads without Witneſſe, they may ſoone doe ſtrange things; now have you done thus, dealt with the Perſon, or two of you gone to the Miniſter, and told him, you know ſuch things by ſuch perſons, which you can and will prove, ſuch things, as if not repented of, make him unfit for the Ordinance?
<note place="margin">See Maſter <hi>Barro,</hi> Hoſ. cap. 5. v. 3.</note> and hath the Miniſter yet received him [if he hath, you have diſcharged your duty, and no guilt lyeth on you, you may partake] I doubt there are few have done-thus, but if they be perſons of quality (eſpecially) then you pull in your hornes, afraid to appeare, but yet you will have the Miniſter to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend him, when no Witneſſe comes in (contrary to the rule) or elſe you ſeparate; this blame will lye on your owne heads.</p>
            <p>All your ſhift here is, we have no power to deale with men, we want an explicite Covenant.</p>
            <p>Though I could heartily wiſh all our Miniſters would follow the practiſe of the <hi>Holland</hi> Churches, who cauſe all,
<note place="margin">Apollon.</note> who come to the Sacrament, to promiſe <hi>to ſubject to Diſcipline,</hi> yet for the preſent I ſay this, there is an implicite Covenant in all theſe Churches, and if you be afraid to ſpeake to theſe perſons firſt, whom you would have ſuſpended, then goe to the Miniſter, and carry ſufficient Witneſſes [as you muſt doe in any Church] and
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:117994:29"/>I am confident, without ſatisfaction given [no more can be required in any Church] thouſands of the Presbyteriall Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters will keepe away ſcandalous perſons; [at leaſt you are cleare as I ſaid before] yet to ſee theſe men ſeparate for that, in which themſelves are moſt to blame.</p>
            <p>Obj. <hi>But they baptize all Children, making no difference though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo ſcandalous.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Though this is very ſeldome urged, yet becauſe I would draw out all that can be ſaid, I adde this.</p>
            <p>For my owne practiſe, I confeſſe in this I differ from other men farre better then my ſelfe, but yet were I a Member of ſome other Presbyteriall Congregation, I ſhould not dare to ſeparate upon this ground.</p>
            <p n="1">1 It is granted by our Congregationall men,

That the ſtrongeſt Party in the Towne is religious; but had many Presbyteriall men the ſame advantage, I beleeve you ſhould ſee they would be more ſtrict then now they are.

That if perſons would refuſe to ſubmit to Church-Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, they would deny them the Lords Supper.</p>
            <p>Since then it is in the hearts of many to reforme, and it is the thing they would gladly have power to doe, I thinke it is very unwarrantable upon this ground to ſeparate from them; beſides, there are many reaſons they give for Baptizing of all that doe but <hi>profeſſe Christ,</hi> which though they are not ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory unto me, ſo as to give the Seale of the Govenant to one, who ſaith, <hi>He beleeves in Chriſt,</hi> but yet is <hi>groſly ignorant, ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,</hi> &amp;c. yet their reaſons prevaile with me ſo, as to be very charitable to thoſe, who doe Baptize upon thoſe grounds; if there be any ſinne in it, let the Miniſter looke to that, that is not your fault.</p>
            <p>Certainly, people thinke it is a very eaſie thing to reforme Churches, it may be done with a wet finger; but if they were in the place of Miniſters, and had what knowledge is fit for the place, they would finde it a hard Worke, eſpecially ſome Churches.</p>
            <p>So then as yet we finde no grounds warrantable for this Separation: I come to the laſt; <hi>The place of meeting, it is Idolatrous, and I know not what.</hi>

            <p>I thought here to have given in ſome anſwers to this abſurd cavill, but the practiſe of this generation hath given in a full anſwer; for it was obſerved in a neighbour Towne, the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter not preaching upon a day of Thankſgiving, a Trooper got into the Pulpit, and did, &amp;c. This was ſuch a pretty thing, that divers of the Separatiſts in the Towne, who had not beene in the <hi>Steeple-houſe</hi> for ſome yeares before, ranne in haſte, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came Auditors of the Trooper. Another of them, who called himſelfe the <hi>King of England,</hi> came to me, and offered to ſupply my place [the man was mad, as errour had made him mad, but for all civill actions ſober enough:] now from theſe pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſes I gather, that either it is no ſinne to meet in a <hi>Steeple-houſe</hi> [as they call it] or elſe they have no good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, theſe practiſes are frequent, if Troopers get into Pulpits.</p>

            <p>Very good, but are all the Separatiſts of this minde, doe they require no more of their Miniſters?

            <p>To cavill here, they were indeed elected, but not by the godly Party, it is very falſe, firſt of hundreds of the Miniſters, ſome viſible Saints had their Vote, or gave after their conſent; I beleeve many of you, who now ſeparate, did joyne in the Call of the Miniſter, from whom you now ſeparate, which is worſe; but however this is a feeble Objection.</p>
            <pb n="49" facs="tcp:117994:31"/>
            <p n="3">3 Before they renounce their Ordination, you muſt prove they have not ſo much as the ſubſtance, and eſſence of that Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance; they will acknowledge accidentall corruptions, but ſtill affirme they have the eſſence, and this none of you all have diſproved.</p>
            <p n="4">4 In this which you require you intimate, that they are no Miniſters at all, for if they be true Miniſters, though there were ſomething humane mixed in their Call, their worke muſt be to renounce thoſe humane mixtures [which they doe] but if they be not true Miniſters, have not ſo much as the eſſentials of the Office, then they are no Miniſters at all; Conſequently, wee have had no ordinances at all; if you ſay, Yes, I pray tell me, how may any one, who is not an Officer diſpenſe the Seales, preach Authoritatively, &amp;c? You practiſe indeed ſome of you as if hee might, but it is a thing abhorred of all men, both Claſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicall, and Congregationall; God is a God of order in his Houſe, as well as in the world: In the Civill State none muſt be Juſtices of Peace, unleſſe ſet apart to the Office,
<note place="margin">Heb. 5.4 Ier. 14.14</note> every man cannot make Warrants, nor execute Juſtice [yet ſome men have as much knowledge in the Law, as many Juſtices have] but in the Church of God, there muſt be no order. Our Miniſters then have been but <hi>private</hi> men, all this while they have diſpenſed the Ordinances: it is the <hi>Call</hi> to a Place, or Office, that makes men Officers or publick perſons, but <hi>Call</hi> they have none by your eſteeme.</p>
            <p>Learned <hi>Chamier</hi> proves,
<note place="margin">To. 4. l. 5. c. 14. Survey ch. diſ. part 2. pag. 42. 45</note> That Baptiſme adminiſtred by a private perſon is no Sacrament at all.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> ſpeakes home to this point: he layed downe this concluſion; That <hi>there is a cauſall vertue put forth in a ſubordinate way under Chriſt, to bring in the ſpecificall being of an Eccleſiaſticall Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to a perſon, &amp;c. After three things premiſed he comes to a fourth, viz. Perſons though gifted and fitted every way, be they never ſo many, they are not therefore Officers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A call they muſt have, without which none can warrantably doe any act, which belongs to an Officer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Without this, whatever is done in that behalfe is voyd, and of none effect.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The validity of an outward Call appeares in this, if it proceeds from ſuch, who may give it by rule, becauſe whoſoever hath regularly received this Call, he is then a true Officer, though not inwardly graced, and fitted worthily to ſuch a place, &amp;c.</hi>

            <pb n="50" facs="tcp:117994:32"/>
            <p>Afterwards he ſpeakes to this purpoſe againe;
<note place="margin">Pag. 3. p. 9</note> 
               <hi>It is a Frenzie of the Anabaptiſts, which begins to labour with the loathſomeneſſe of it ſelfe, that any Chriſtian gifted, who can teach, or adminiſter a word of inſtruction to win a Diſciple after him, that he in a corner may Baptize him; but as</hi> Paul <hi>ſaid of</hi> Jannes <hi>and</hi> Jambres, <hi>their madneſſe is made to appeare to all, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>If the Lord Chriſt in his infinite Wiſdome, and Kingly care, conceived it neceſſary for the honour of the place, and the execution of the worke of a Deacon, to appoint choice men, and ſolemne Ordination to Authorize them to the worke, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſumme is, the practiſe is but loathſome, and the Acts of ſuch men are voyd, who doe ſuch things as properly belong to a Church-Officer, and are not called to the Office; thus Mr. <hi>Hooker.</hi>

            <p>Hence then if you <hi>null</hi> their Call, you muſt <hi>null</hi> all the Acts they have done as Miniſters, and you will be troubled (as I ſaid before) which way to come into order; you had better therefore be quiet, and if you wil needs quarrell with their Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination, yet content your ſelves with their election, which you ſay is the chiefe.</p>
            <p>Before I paſſe on to my laſt anſwer, let me a little examine this <hi>Theſis,</hi> viz. <hi>Election gives the eſſentials, and Ordination is but an Adjunct.</hi> Heretofore I have indeed been of this opinion, never much weighing the thing, being wholly carried away with the Authority of Dr. <hi>Ames,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Hooker,</hi> and others, admiring their learning and holineſſe, ſeeing my ſelfe but a meere babe in compariſon of theſe men, and ſo I judge of my ſelfe ſtill; but I remember a paſſage of Mr. <hi>Hookers</hi> in his conference with forty Miniſters, ſaid he, <hi>We ſee things fall cut in our Churches, which puts us upon further ſearches;</hi> ſo when I obſerved what uſe is made of this <hi>Theſis</hi> in <hi>England</hi> amongſt our <hi>Sectaries,</hi> and what confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is brought upon us, for any number of <hi>Sectaries</hi> will elect one (be he what he will) but Election gives the eſſence, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination is but an Adjunct, therefore may be left out; theſe practiſes have made me to ſearch further into this opinion, this being my greateſt trouble, that if I caſt off the opinion, I muſt go croſſe to ſuch men, whom I doe ſo much admire and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence; I am apt to thinke our holy Men did in this as our firſt

               <hi>Reformers</hi> did in other points; <hi>Luther</hi> let ſome words fall againſt the <hi>Law,</hi> which might have beene ſpared; ſo our Divines in their definition of <hi>ſaving Faith,</hi> in oppoſition to the <hi>Papiſts;</hi> ſo in this point the Papiſts cryed up ordination too high, ours now are runne on the other ſide, and cry up <hi>popular election</hi> as high, and cry downe <hi>Ordination,</hi> but ſurely a <hi>medium</hi> might have beene found out, which had come nearer to the rule (with ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion I ſpeake it.)</p>
            <p>Reverend Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> layes downe his <hi>Theſis</hi> thus,
<note place="margin">Survey part. 2. pag. 66.</note> 
               <hi>Election of the people rightly ordered by the rule of Chriſt</hi> (I wiſh he had ſet downe this right order) <hi>gives the eſſentials to an officer,</hi> &amp;c. but I doubt (with honour to this choice Saint) he hath not layed downe his <hi>Theſis</hi> ſo cleare, as Dr. <hi>Ames</hi> (whom he quotes after) I preſume he intends the <hi>acceptation</hi> of the perſon <hi>elected</hi> muſt concurre; nay, I will affirme the <hi>acceptation</hi> is as eſſential, as their <hi>election,</hi> for what if this, or that, or foure Churches more chuſe I will refuſe them all, if I pleaſe; if election gives the eſſentials, then it ſeems I muſt be a Paſtor to that people, who elects me, wil I, nill I; but this reverend Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> will not owne: then I ſay election doth not give the eſſentialls. Secondly, I ſay my own <hi>acceptation,</hi> is as eſſentiall to my <hi>Call,</hi> as their election, therefore Dr. <hi>Ames</hi> layes it thus,
<note place="margin">Medul. Th. l. 1. c. 39. ſ. 32.</note> 
               <hi>Vocationis eſſentia eſt in electione Eccleſiae, &amp; acceptatione electi;</hi> but this is not material, for our <hi>Sectaries</hi> are forward enough to <hi>accept,</hi> if any will <hi>elect.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In ſearching out this truth, I ſhall deſire to ſet by all men, and conſult with the Scriptures; I wil firſt ſearch what texts we have for <hi>Election,</hi> then what for <hi>Ordination,</hi> and this I ſet down with my ſelf, that if <hi>Ordination</hi> be but an <hi>Adjunct,</hi> &amp; the <hi>election</hi> ſo <hi>eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall,</hi> then the Texts for Election are farre more <hi>cleare, full;</hi> and thoſe for <hi>Ordination</hi> more <hi>dark</hi> and <hi>rare;</hi> for an Adjunct, the meaneſt Logician knowes, is but little in compariſon of an eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentiall cauſe; it doth <hi>conſentire,</hi> but <hi>modo quodam;</hi> 2. It ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the <hi>ſubject compleat in its eſſence</hi> before; 3. Therefore <hi>poteſt ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſſe;</hi> much might be ſpoken this way.</p>
            <p>The Texts I finde for Election are three; neither doe I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve our Divines to quote any more.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The firſt is, <hi>Act.</hi> 1.23. where we have theſe things obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable, as here are eleven Apoſtles in this election, but we allow thoſe to chooſe, where there is no officer to guide them, and many times very weak perſons.</p>
            <pb n="52" facs="tcp:117994:33"/>
            <p n="2">2. It is very eaſie to chooſe one of theſe, for <hi>v.</hi> 21. It was one who <hi>had accompanied them from the time, &amp;c.</hi> This was eaſie for the meaneſt to know, but to chooſe a man fit for a Paſtor, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires more skill then ſo.</p>
            <p n="3">3. If we obſerve it narrowly, they did not ſo properly elect the Apoſtle, for when they had appointed two, <hi>Joſeph</hi> and <hi>Matthias</hi> ſuppoſe one ſhould have asked <hi>Peter,</hi> or the reſt, which of theſe is the Apoſtle? he muſt have ſaid he could not tell, properly God made the election: then they knew who was the Apoſtle, like to ſome <hi>Corporations</hi> in the choice of a Mayor, the floore no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate two, but the Aldermen chooſe which they will have, whence the people ſay, <hi>The Aldermen chooſe the Mayor.</hi> 1. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing may here be gathered for popular election, but very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent is this practiſe from ours; I could adde other ſcruples, but I forbeare.</p>
            <p n="2">2 The ſecond place is <hi>Act.</hi> 6.3. a very cleare place for the popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar election of a Deacon, but the laſt words of the verſe do very much ſhake this notion of Ordination, being but an adjunct, yea, it ſhakes the eſſentiall cauſality of popular election, <hi>Doe yee looke on, &amp;c.</hi> but they adde, <hi>whom Wee may appoint over this buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</hi> How doe the Apoſtles appoint them over the buſineſſe? It is by <hi>Ordination</hi> verſ. 16. Thoſe that doe authoritatively ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point another, or others over ſome buſineſſe, they put forth a cauſall vertue ſurely in that appointing; theſe appointed by this Act of Ordination [the Apoſtles did not not meddle here with the election] then the Apoſtles Ordination was more then an Adjunct.</p>
            <p>From this place Divines argue commonly, If they may chooſe Deacons, then much more Paſtors, to whom they are more engaged, muſt honour, maintaine them, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Thus we argue one while a <hi>majori,</hi> the people elected an Apoſtle, <hi>ergo,</hi> they may elect a Paſtor; here now a <hi>minori,</hi> the people elect a Deacon, <hi>ergo,</hi> they may elect a Paſtor, but then thoſe Axioms one of them muſt bee falſe, <hi>a majori licet</hi>

               </gap>, both which experience proves to be falſe, and Logicians obſerve it; but put the caſe we ſhould queſtion this argument; The people may elect a Deacon, <hi>ergo,</hi> their Paſtor; election followeth the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and is guided by it, but muſt we needs ſuppoſe the people to be as able to judge, who is fit for a Paſtor, as who is fit for a

            </p>
            <p>1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.14. <hi>With the laying on of the hands of the Presbytery:</hi> I know not that this Text is queſtioned by our Divines, Mr. <hi>Hooker,</hi> and our <hi>New England</hi> Divines from this Text conceive <hi>Impoſition of hands</hi> in Ordination to be neareſt the rule, as I have quoted them before.</p>
            <p>1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.22. Though ſome would have it of the admitting of penitents, of which we have no example in Scripture, yet the common interpretation is of impoſition of hands in Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination; this interpretation hath other Scriptures to confirme it, the other none.</p>
            <p>1 <hi>Tit.</hi> 5. <hi>Ordaine Elders in every City.</hi> I doe not finde that our Divines oppoſe this place neither. What <hi>Sectaries</hi> carp at, I weigh not.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rom.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Miſcel. p. 37.</note> 10.15. <hi>How ſhall they preach, except they be ſent?</hi> Mr. <hi>Gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſpy</hi> hath, I thinke, ſufficiently cleared this Text. To be ſure, he is not alone in his interpretation. He likewiſe clears Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from that, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.4. and firſt verſes.</p>
            <p>Now ſince the Scripture is more copious, and plaine in giving us examples, and preſidents of ordination of Miniſters, then of the peoples election of Miniſters (though I grant ſomething may well be drawne out of thoſe Texts for election againſt the Papiſts, beſides the ancient courſe of the Church) I cannot ſee any reaſon (if Scripture be our guide) why we ſhould cloath theſe Texts for Ordination with this logicall affection of an <hi>Adjunct,</hi> and the other with the affection of a <hi>formall cauſe:</hi> I ſhould put moſt upon that, where the Scripture is plaineſt and fulleſt, which I am ſure in any mans eſteeme, that obſerves thoſe Texts with an impartiall eye, is ordination.</p>
            <p>Whether <hi>Ordination</hi> according to <hi>Scripture-light</hi> be not as eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentiall to a Miniſter as <hi>Election,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vind. chu. Cath. viſ.</note> let any one judge. I thinke Mr. <hi>Hudſon</hi> ſpeakes Chriſtianly, <hi>I preferre one Divine Teſtimony, before ten arguments, and one good argument, before ten humane Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies.</hi>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:117994:34"/>But thus by cloathing theſe Scriptures with theſe logicall affections, we have cried up election, and cryed downe Ordination, ſectaries take advantage of this, and hence come in our diſorders. Ordination is a Divine inſtitution.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ars eſt in rebus,</hi> and Logicke is a generall Art, ſo that we muſt give ſome logical terms to Election and Ordination: I deny not this, onely it is good to bring Art to Scripture, and not carry Scripture to Art: If you aske, what logicall Arguments are there betweene a Miniſters call, and Election and Ordination?
<note place="margin">I ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore theſe two con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute the form of a Miniſter, <hi>mutatâ af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectione, mutatur argumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum.</hi> Survey par. 2. pag. 68. in 4 praec.</note> what if I ſhould anſwer, The Call is <hi>Totum integrale,</hi> Election and Ordination are <hi>membra</hi> conſtituting this <hi>Totum;</hi> Thus I make Election to be eſſentiall, and ſo I ſpeake the higheſt of Election, though I muſt profeſſe upon ſerious thought, I rather queſtion whether <hi>Election</hi> be eſſentiall, then I doe <hi>Ordination.</hi> Reverend Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> indeed ſaith, <hi>Ordination</hi> is but the <hi>approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of a perſon <hi>conſtituted</hi> in his office; but I am apt to thinke, <hi>Ordination</hi> doth moſt reſpect that inward, or <hi>Arcanam vocatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem</hi> (as <hi>Zanchy</hi> calls it) which God gives a man into the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, fitting and qualifying of a man firſt for the worke (which none elſe can do) and giving him an earneſt deſire to the worke, God did there as it were, ſeparate him inwardly, and now he doth it outwardly in <hi>Ordination.</hi> The particular Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion doth but give him a <hi>Call</hi> by their election and ſubjection to him, to exerciſe this power among them <hi>pro hic &amp; nunc;</hi> That which moves me to thinke ſo is,</p>
            <p>Firſt, Churches may not chooſe whom they liſt (as doe our Sectaries) but perſons qualified by God.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the Scripture is ſo full and cleare for <hi>Ordination</hi> over it is for <hi>Election,</hi> though I deny not but Election may well bee proved.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, becauſe a man may in ſome caſes be ordained to the Miniſtry, when no <hi>election</hi> of the people doth precede, as I ſhall give inſtance afterward.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I argue thus:</p>
            <p>If the election of the people doth give the eſſentials to an officer, then may a man elected execute all officiall power with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ordination, and that commonly.</p>
            <p>But no man may execute officiall power, and that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly without ordination; <hi>ergo,</hi> election doth not give the eſſentialls; by the eſſentials here, he meanes the <hi>formall</hi> cauſe,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:117994:35"/>for as for the materiall cauſe, they cannot give that, and we have but two cauſes that doe <hi>dare eſſentiam,</hi> though all foure doe <hi>dare eſſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The conſequence is cleare, that they may execute, &amp;c. with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ordination, for <hi>forma dat operari;</hi> but election gives the forme, ſay theſe Reverend men, and ordination is but an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junct, effects doe not depend upon Adjuncts, for operation the forme gives that.</p>
            <p>The minor, that they muſt not doe ſo.</p>
            <p>Firſt, it is croſſe to Scripture preſidents; if it were but a Deacon,
<note place="margin">Survey part. 3. pag. 9.</note> ſaith Mr. <hi>Hooker,</hi> yet, we ſee, he was ordained.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It is croſſe to your owne practiſe; it is frequent in <hi>New England</hi> to have a man elected, and preach halfe a yeare, a whole yeare, yea, I know one elected and preached two yeares to his people, and they maintained him all that while, and yet all that time he never adminiſtred a Sacrament to his people, but he and they, when they would partake of the Lords Supper, went ten miles to the Church, out of which they iſſued, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Sacrament; but this was very hard and needleſſe, if he had the <hi>forme</hi> given him in election.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That which doth nextly inveſt a man with official power, ſo as now he may performe officiall acts, and before which he could not doe ſo, that doth give eſſence, and conſequently is not a meer adjunct.</p>
            <p>But Ordination doth nextly inveſt a Miniſter with official power, ſo as now he may perfome official acts, which before he could not doe; <hi>ergo,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The minor is clear by the Scripture examples.</p>
            <p>Secondly, it is clear by your owne practiſe, for thoſe who for two yeares, and more, ſtood onely by election, but that while diſpenſed no Sacraments, when they were ordained, did pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently put forth all official acts.</p>
            <p>The major, take all together, I ſuppoſe will not be denied; it doth nextly inveſt a man with official power, ſo as now he can performe official acts, and before he could not doe it; to ſay he had official power before given him by election, but could not act it, is ſtrange, <hi>fruſtra eſt illa potentia, &amp;c.</hi> had ſuch a perſon continued twice as long unordained, he had not exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted any official power, nay, his preaching all that time was not eſteemed preaching by way of office.</p>
            <pb n="57" facs="tcp:117994:35"/>
            <p>Neither can it be ſaid ſuch preach onely upon triall, for I now ſpeake of ſuch, as had beene tried before, nay, have beene preachers in <hi>England</hi> long before they went over, and ſuch I am ſure, as the people would willingly had them ordained within one month after they had choſen them, they were ſo well ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in the perſons, whom they had choſen.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, it is ſomething that ſolemnity the Scripture ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth, that was in the ordination of Miniſters, <hi>prayer</hi> and <hi>faſting,</hi> and <hi>impoſition of hands:</hi> we read of no ſuch ſolemnity in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, though people ought to pray before they doe chooſe. So it was in <hi>New England,</hi> this act was very ſolemne; when no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice was given of the ordination of an officer to the ſeverall Churches (as before any ordination, all the Churches adjacent had notice given) it ran in that forme, <hi>There is an Ordination to be this weeke at ſuch a Church, &amp;c.</hi> for the election of the perſon, we knew it long before, whom they had choſen, and though the people did by their ſuffrage declare their election in this day of Humiliation, yet they declared no more then the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try knew before; and I hope you will not ſay, he was not elected before now, when firſt they choſe him to goe with them, or come to them, and there continued a yeare or two preaching, &amp; they contributing to his maintenance; the ſame I might ſay in regard of myſelf, I had as ful an election of my people at my firſt coming, as was declared at my ordination, and it was above two years, before I could get my ordination in the place where I was elected (through the troubles of the times) but all that while I did not conceive my ſelfe inveſted with official power, till I was alſo ordained. The Scripture then expreſſing ſuch ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity in this act, and not in the other, makes me thinke, this is not ſuch a ſlight Adjunct, and the other onely eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, I obſerve two Texts, which make me think ordination is not an Adjunct, 2 Tim. 2. <hi>And the things which thou haſt heard of me among many witneſſes, the ſame commit thou to faithfull men, who ſhould be able to teach others alſo.</hi> And that Text, 1 Tim. 5.22. <hi>Lay hands ſuddenly upon no man, neither be partakers of other mens ſins &amp;c. Timothy</hi> is a Church-officer, here is a charge given to him to take heed, who comes into the Miniſtry, yea, he may be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker of other mens ſinnes, if he have not a ſpeciall care, whom he admitteth into the Miniſtry, <hi>Nam ſi quem cito ordinaveris, qui
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:117994:36"/>indignus ſit,

Calvin</hi> alſo on the laſt words, <hi>Keep thy ſelfe pure; Ac ſi dixiſſet, ſi quid perperam fiat ab aliis, vide ne ulla ex conſenſu, vel approbatione contagio ad te perveniat.</hi> He referres it to <hi>Timothy,</hi> joyning with others in ordaining unworthy perſons; now theſe texts doe not belong to the people, but Miniſters, Officers, as was <hi>Timothy,</hi> which makes me thinke, that what the Miniſters doe in <hi>examining, try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ordaining,</hi> is more then the peoples election; where doe we finde ſuch things ſpoken to the people? <hi>Where the greateſt blame lyes, for unworthy men coming into the Miniſtry, ſurely there muſt lye the greateſt power of admitting men into the Miniſtry, elſe the blame is not juſt;</hi> but we ſee the blame is here layed upon the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters;
<note place="margin">☞</note> 
               <hi>Paul</hi> no where writes to the people to <hi>commit the things they have heard, &amp;c.</hi> nor doth he bid them <hi>not lay on hands ſuddenly, &amp;c.</hi> he bad them indeed looke out men for Deacons, but that doth not anſwer theſe texts; but if the great ſtroke, <hi>the formall cauſe</hi> lye in the <hi>popular election,</hi> the Miniſters may well ſay, <hi>We doe but ordaine, we give but an Adjunct, the people did the maine Act, they gave the eſſence, the eſſence being given, we muſt give the Adjunct,</hi> ſo that there will be no blame left for the Miniſters.</p>

               <hi>Ames,</hi> that <hi>ordination</hi> is more then an Adjunct; <hi>Bellarmine</hi> had ſaid, <hi>Vocatio ſeu miſſio miniſtrorum non ad populum pertinet, ſed ad Epiſcopos, &amp;c.</hi> Doct. <hi>Ames</hi> in his ſecond anſwer hath theſe words; <hi>Abſurdè ad modum di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguitur vocatio miniſtri, ab ejus Ordinatione &amp; electione, tanquam pars diſtincta; neque in Scripturis, neque in antiquis Patribus alia voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio ordinaria memoratur, quam illa, quae exurgit, quaſi Totum, ex electio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne &amp; ordinatione:</hi> what <hi>Totum</hi> the Doctor meanes, is plaine by his words, <hi>Exurgit ex ordinatione &amp; electione,</hi> he meanes <hi>Totum integrale;</hi> ſo then ordination and election are members of this <hi>Integrum,</hi> but all the members doe give <hi>eſſence</hi> to the <hi>Integrum,</hi> for <hi>Membra ſunt ſymbola cauſarum eſſentialium.</hi> If ſo, then ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion cannot be an Adjunct in reſpect of a Miniſteriall <hi>Call,</hi> for no Adjunct gives <hi>eſſence,</hi> but followes the <hi>eſſence,</hi> ſuppoſing the ſubject compleat in its eſſence before; if then ordination doth give eſſence, as well as election, this notion may hold, elſe we
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:117994:36"/>ſhould have an <hi>Integrum</hi> conſiſting but of two parts, and but one part give the eſſence, which cannot be. This notion of a Miniſters Call to conſiſt as a <hi>Totum ex electione &amp; ordinatione,</hi> is much nearer the Rule, then to have election alone to give the eſſence, and ordination to be but an Adjunct.</p>
            <p>To this agrees Mr. <hi>Jacob</hi> [a man well known] <hi>There are two eſſentiall parts of calling to the Miniſtry, Election, Ordination:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> quotes him, Anſ. to <hi>Diat,</hi> p. 64</note> ſo the <hi>Calling</hi> is a <hi>Totum.</hi> As for the Objections made againſt this, if ordination be eſſentiall, what then ſhall become of our Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, whoſe ordination is not legitimate? This I have ſpoken to before; and ſo, what will you doe in caſe a Church were ſo caſt by providence, that they could get no Officers to Ordaine them an Officer? [for thoſe who are of this opinion deny the People power to ordaine] it is eaſily yeelded by our Divines, that may be done in an extraordinary caſe, which ordinarily ought not to be done. See <hi>Rutherford, Due right of Presbytery,</hi> p. 187. <hi>Gilleſpie, Miſcel.</hi> p. 34. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for my part, I conceive then the Church faſting, and praying, for ſuch a one, who is elected, may doe that which is aequivalent to ordination, though it be not ordination <hi>formalitèr.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſtrong argument where-with reverend Maſter <hi>Hooker</hi> proves, That Election gives the Eſſentials to an Officer is this:
<q>
                  <l>
                     <hi>One Relate gives the eſſentiall conſtituting cauſes to another.</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>But Paſtor and People are Relates;</hi> ergo.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>The anſwer which Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi> gives to it, viz. <hi>That ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made him a Miniſter before, and election doth but appropriate him;</hi> This Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> denyeth to be any anſwer, becauſe it ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth ordination to antecede election, which is quite croſſe to the Scripture pattern, <hi>Act.</hi> 6.3.6. But (with favour) I ſhould humbly propound this queſtion,
<note place="margin">This is not a bare ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, for one of the young Schollars doth now preach to the Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans in their language.</note> Whether Ordination may in no caſe precede election? As now in this caſe, Suppoſe one of the Schollars in the Colledge, or ſuppoſe foure, or more had learned the <hi>Indian</hi> Language, and upon examination they were found to be Miniſterially qualified; ſuppoſe now the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery ſhould ſolemnly ſet apart theſe young men to the worke of the Miniſtry, and ſend them forth to preach among the <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> though the <hi>Indians</hi> have not elected them; here indeed would the eſſentials of an Officer be given without election: I pray what breach of rule would here be? If it be ſaid, that the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:117994:37"/>examples mentioned, <hi>Act.</hi> 6. &amp; <hi>Act.</hi> 14. ſhew their election goes firſt; It is true indeed where there are Churches, but here are none. Beſides, <hi>Act.</hi> 13.3. when <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> were ſent out to preach among the Gentiles they were ordained,
<note place="margin">Though ſome deny ordination here to be meant, yet many lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men affirme it.</note> when no election did precede; it is true, they were extraordinary Officers, but what then? though this doth not make thoſe young men extraordinary Officers, as were the Apoſtles, to have power in all Churches, yet I ſee not any breach of rule in ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating them to this work. If it be ſaid, what need of that Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination, they may preach without? It is true, they may, but it is not ſo comfortable, as when men are ſet apart by a Divine inſtitution, there is an authority more conferred; they may now baptize as they finde ſucceſſe of their Miniſtry (which was the old way) and ſhal not need be put to thoſe troubles, which now they are;

I dare boldly affirme in the Apoſtles times, and the pureſt Ages next them, this notion was never heard. As for this notion of a <hi>Catholick viſible Church,</hi> I have not ſo much buſied my head about it till of late, &amp; in my weak judgement I think, there is ſo much ſaid for it by Mr. <hi>Hudſon</hi> (eſpecially) and others, that I ſuppoſe it will not eaſily be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered; that which made me leane to this opinion, was;</p>

            <p n="4">4.

            <p n="5">5. The practiſes I obſerved in <hi>New England</hi> that did imply ſuch a notion as this, did lead me much to it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. As that members of one Church did ſo frequently par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of the Sacraments, both the Lords Supper, and Baptiſme in other Churches; one Paſtor it may be might adminiſter the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, to the members of five or ſix Churches at one time; <hi>I know it is often ſaid that a Mayor of one Corporation, may adminiſter juſtice to the members of another Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration, if they be under his juriſdiction, but he muſt not goe to them,</hi> but <hi>ſimilia ad pompam, non ad pugnam.</hi> The Analogie betweene a Commonwealth, and the Church will not hold, as I may touch afterward; but this I am ſure, according to that practiſe, that ſeven make a Church, they may admit five or ſix whole Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and a Paſtor choſen by none of them may adminiſter the Sacrament to them all at one time; but doe we finde whole Corporations goe to the Mayor of another Corporation for Juſtice? Mr. <hi>Philips</hi> Paſtor of the Church in <hi>Water-town,</hi> while Mr. <hi>Wilſon</hi> Paſtor of the Church of <hi>Boston</hi> was here in <hi>England,</hi> went to <hi>Boſton,</hi> and adminiſtred the Lords Supper to that Church
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:117994:38"/>(I was not then in the Country, but I heard of it ſoone after, when I went over with Mr. <hi>Wilſon</hi>) I know no ſin in that act. I thought to have given ſome Inſtances, how frequent this was in the Primitive Churches,
<note place="margin">Vind. Cath. à 192 ad 196</note> for one Miniſter to act officially be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the people, who elected him: But Mr. <hi>Hudſon</hi> (a man far more able) hath ſet down thoſe examples, which I would have given, and many more, to whom I referre the Reader; Yea, it was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary for the members of one Church to dwell one or two yeares; nay, ſix, or ſeven yeares in another Towne, and to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of the Sacraments there as frequently, as any of the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of that Church: Indeed of late the Elders have not liked this, to have them live ſo remote from the inſpection of their owne officers, and therefore have required ſuch to joyne with the Church, where they dwell, this is good and orderly: The letters alſo of Recommendation, which the Churches make for the members, when they come over hither, requiring of the Churches here what communion, counſell, or comfort they ſhall need, promiſing the performance of the like debt to others, &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Alſo I ſaw, if a man were excommunicated out of one Church, he ſtood excommunicated out of them all, but if a man be disfranchiſed in one Corporation, another Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may receive him, and give him his freedome, if they pleaſe, this ſhews there is ſomething more in a Church, then in a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth.</p>
            <p n="3">3. I ſaw they preached frequently in other Churches, but that it ſhould be onely, as gifted brethren, this is ſo harſh to conceive: I pray what act doth the <hi>mayor</hi> of one Corporation do in another Corporation like this, that carries authority in it? and that here we muſt diſtinguiſh of the <hi>Mayor,</hi> if he did this at home, he did it as <hi>a Mayor authoritatively,</hi> but in this Corporation he doth it as a private man?</p>
            <p>Further, they are Miniſters or Paſtors onely to thoſe, who elect, and the fraternity only elect (where there is no officer) but there are divers in the ſeverall Townes, who are not joyned to the Churches, ſo they did not elect, then it ſeemes they preach as paſtors, onely to thoſe, who elected; but to the reſt of the Towne, as gifted men; conſequently, when God bleſſes their labours to the converſion of any of thoſe, they convert them (inſtrumentally) not as Miniſters of Chriſt, ordained, ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:117994:39"/>to that worke, but onely as gifted men; yea, they never convert any, as Miniſters, unleſſe ſome of thoſe, who elected them be cloſe hypocrites, and ſo they convert them; but ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily thoſe, who chooſe, are reputed godly already, and they are Miniſters only to them. Hence riſes that vile notion, that ſome here have taken up, <hi>That Paſtors ſhould preach onely to the edification of the Saints, not to others.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. I have heard ſince I came away, that when people have choſen an Officer, and had no Officers to ordaine him, that the Miniſters of other Congregations have done it, and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Church-diſcipline by the Synod of <hi>New England,</hi> as alſo Mr. <hi>Hooker,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Survey part. 2. pag. 59.</note> allow as much.</p>
            <p n="5">5. If one Congregation ſhould prove pertinaciouſly ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous, and hereticall, then though they doe not <hi>formally</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate ſuch a Congregation, yet all the Churches in the Country would proceed to the <hi>Non-communion</hi> of ſuch a Church; and for all the Churches to expreſſe ſo much to ſuch a Church, <hi>We do all renounce communion with you, &amp;c.</hi> this amounts to a cenſure, and is equivalent to excommunication, contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in it all the effects, that appear in excommunication, and ſo I ſhould reckon my ſelfe as much excommunicated.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Burroughs</hi> ſaith, <hi>They may by a ſolemne act in the name of Chriſt,
<note place="margin">Iren. 43.</note> refuſe any communion with them, till they repent. They may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare in the name of Chriſt, that theſe erring Churches are not to be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved into fellowſhip with any Churches of Chriſt, nor to have communion one with another in the Ordinances of Chriſt; all this ſolemnly in Chriſts name:</hi> Onely ſome (may be) will ſay, if this be an Ordinance of Chriſt, bring out the texts to prove this, and then we ſhall ſee, if thoſe texts wil not beare it out, that the Churches united thus in this cenſure, have not ſome authority over that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Church. If you goe to the old politie, the <hi>Synedrion</hi> had power over particular Congregations; if to light of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that will carry it; ſo that we muſt have texts to decide this Queſtion. For my part I muſt leave this to better heads.</p>
            <p>Laying all together, the Churches ſeeme to pactiſe, as if there were ſuch a Church.</p>
            <p>Some things there are, which a little trouble me in this no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that make me not come off ſo roundly in receiving it; I queſtion not the Church-catholicke-viſible, but I meane that
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:117994:39"/>it is one organicall body, but as he ſaid <hi>Veritas eſt temporis filia,</hi> ſo I beleeve Time will cleave out this, but ſo much I ſee, as commands me to lean to that ſide.</p>
            <p>I was thinking how dangerous this might prove; If the major part of the Catholick-viſible-church ſhould decline, grow ſuperſtitious &amp;c. other Churches yet remaining pure, if they did not ſubject to the major part, what then? but I ſaw incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences alſo on the other ſide, if a Congregation be ſo entire, that they can elect, ordaine, and are exempted from all power, then Arians, Photinians, and all manner of Hereticks may elect, ordaine, &amp;c. who ſhall deny them? and beſides, ſuppoſe the major part of Congregationall Churches ſhould decline, they would proceed to Non-communion of other particular Churches more pure, and this is in a manner all one.</p>
            <p>Further, If ſo, then if a Miniſter be removed from one Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation to another, or if his people ſhould dye, he now is but a private perſon, and may nor baptiſe, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Hence alſo he muſt have another ordination when elected, and as oft as he is elected;
<note place="margin">I have not heard any there, but here al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadge it.</note> I confeſſe I am not cleare in the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe; I have ſearched to finde what Scripturall grounds there were for it, but I find none that theſe Reverend Elders expreſſe; ſome have alleadged in conference, that <hi>Act.</hi> 13.3. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> were ordained before, and now they are ordained againe: but I finde Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> ſaying,

               <hi>here was no ordination to office at all. Survey part.</hi> 2. <hi>pag.</hi> 83. then I perceive this will not warrant it; I finde learned <hi>Chamier</hi> alſo of that opinion, he ſaith,
<note place="margin">So our Engliſh Annotati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and Calv. in Loc.</note> there was not properly any ordination into a new Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall office, but <hi>confirmatio miſſionis ad Gentes, ad quas non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum erant ex profeſsò miſſi.</hi> The Author of the Diatribe, ſaith they were Miniſters before, <hi>Act.</hi> 12. <hi>ult.</hi> but I doubt that place will not prove it, for their fulfilling of their <hi>Miniſtry</hi> or <hi>Charge</hi> there, may refer to C. 11.29, 30. the carrying of the relief to the Saints at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which they might do, though no Apoſtles.</p>
            <p>Here then we are in the dark what to judge of the text, if we reſt onely upon mens opinions, there are many, who are for the contrary opinion, that here was ordination, as I have named before, and I thinke thoſe, whom <hi>Chamier</hi> quotes in the twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth Section of the former Chapter, conceive ſo, ſaith he, <hi>Act.</hi> 13. <hi>Imponuntur manus Paulo, &amp; Barnabae mittendis ad Evangelii praedicationem in Gentes, quid hoc eſt?

I dare not ſay that theſe were not Apoſtles before now, becauſe I ſee ſo many Divines are of that opinion; for <hi>Barnabas</hi> we finde him made mention of, <hi>Act.</hi> 4.36. a Levite, and a man of excellent gifts, no doubt, as it appeares in Chap. 11. but to ſay he was an Apoſtle before, I doe not ſee it made ſo cleare, <hi>Act.</hi> 13.1. There were Prophets and Teachers, as <hi>Barnabas,</hi> ſo that <hi>Barnabas</hi> was one of them, but as yet not an Apoſtle, for we know theſe are diſtinguiſhed, Apoſtles, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, &amp;c. though I dare not gain-ſay it, but impute it rather to my ignorance; for <hi>Paul,</hi> there ſeemeth to bee more ſaid for him, <hi>Act.</hi> 9 for thoſe that ſay <hi>Ananias</hi> his impoſition of hands upon <hi>Paul,</hi> was to ſeparate him to the worke of his Apoſtleſhip (for that was one end of Impoſition of hands) I dare not oppoſe Divines in this,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pareus</hi> upon Gal. 1.1. when <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith he was an Apoſtle <hi>not by man,</hi> thinks he points to this Act. 9. but ſo he was not, though here he were firſt called to that office for his call was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate, as <hi>Chamier</hi> notes.

But ſuppoſe they were Apoſtles, yet wil this text be ſufficient proofe to maintaine, that Miniſters muſt bee newly ordained, if they remove from one particular Congregation to another? I am ſure there may bee ſufficient grounds, given, why they may remove; if indeed the caſe were now, as then it

            <p>From which places I gather it was not their manner to ite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Ordination; indeed Scripture and ſtrong Argument, is more then humane Teſtimony; but that is not ſufficient to ſay, <hi>Ordination</hi> is but the <hi>approbation</hi> of a perſon <hi>conſtituted</hi> in his office, unleſſe it could be proved that <hi>Ordination</hi> is no more, which will eaſily be denyed.</p>
            <p>For our Moderne Divines, I do not know any that maintaine this iteration of Ordination, in caſe a man remove from the place where he was firſt ordained.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Argument which Reverend Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> uſeth to prove that <hi>Election</hi> gives the eſſentials, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is this:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It is lawfull for the people to reject a Paſtor upon juſt cauſes, and put him out of his office, ergo, it is in their power to Call him outwardly, and put him into his office.</hi> By this <hi>Rejection,</hi> he means <hi>Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> for ſo he ſaith afterward, <hi>This rejection cuts him off from being a member, &amp;c.</hi> So conſequently it muſt needs make him ceaſe from being an officer.</p>
            <p>For that phraſe of <hi>putting him into his office,</hi> if it be taken <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundum quid,</hi> and as to <hi>their officer,</hi> it hath not beene oppoſed,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:117994:41"/>but if taken abſolutely, that their <hi>election</hi> makes him a Miniſter, (as Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> doth) that is it which is denied.</p>
            <p>As for the Antecedent, whether people have power to reject, (or if you meane <hi>Excommunication,</hi> as it ſeemes that is meant) that is another queſtion; If there be officers, and the people conſent with them to caſt out an officer, pertinaciouſly ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and hereticall, none doubt of that; but for the people, being but a homogeneall body, to reject, <hi>i.e.</hi> excommunicate an oſſicer, will coſt more to prove; had Reverend Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> beene alive, and ſaw what work Church-members make here in <hi>England</hi> in very many Churches, I thinke it would have cauſed him to bethinke himſelfe againe of the peoples power. Something we heare of, is done in a Church not farre from the place where he lived, it cannot be kept cloſe; the light of that fire ſhines into <hi>England.</hi> For the people to withdraw their ſubjection from ſuch an officer, when there are no other officers to joyne with them to excommunicate him, this is not denied, for by their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to him, they made him <hi>their officer</hi> (that was ſome part) ſo they may withdraw their ſubjection againe.</p>

               <hi>If the Church be without officers, they cannot doe that which belongs to officers to doe, they have no Sacraments amongſt them, neither can they have any ſpirituall juriſdiction exerciſed amongſt them, onely brotherly admonition, and withdrawing from ſuch as walke diſorderly, for their owne preſervation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So then here is a way for the people to preſerve themſelves though they cannot excommunicate, and thoſe Texts which Reverend Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> brings, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.15. and <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.2. doe not prove the Church, as a homogencal body, to have power to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate their officers, though they may prove with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing, as alſo <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.17. may prove it.</p>
            <p>For the reaſon of his conſequence, that ſtaple rule, <hi>ejuſdem eſt Inſtituere, deſtituere,</hi> this maxime is turned every way, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to prove the people may excommunicate their officers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they doe <hi>Inſtituere.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The people in <hi>Election</hi> put forth no act of juriſdiction, therefore they may put forth the higheſt act of juriſdiction, in excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication; that there is no act of juriſdiction in election,

S. 13.</note> to argue from ſubjection, to the higheſt Act of Juriſdiction? there was no Authority in election, for <hi>electio non cogit</hi> [yet there is more power ſeene in Civill elections, then Church-elections, as I ſhall touch afterward] but in Excommunication, Authority appeares. That alſo is denied, that the people doe <hi>inſtituere</hi> in conſtituted Chruches, and ordinarily what may be done in an extraordinary caſe is no ordinary rule.</p>
            <p>Here the maxime is turned, to prove that they may <hi>Jnſtituere,</hi> becauſe they can <hi>deſtituere,</hi> but that will be denyed, unleſſe it be in the ſence before mentioned, <hi>i. e.</hi> in what manner, and how farre they did <hi>inſtituere,</hi> i.e. by a ſubjection to be <hi>their Officer,</hi> ſo they may with-draw their ſubjection from him, and not owne him to be their Officer; but to Excommunicate is more.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <q>
                  <hi>But ſuppoſe this be granted, that the Fraternity cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate ;their Officer, but with-draw their ſubjection they may, you ſay, and ſo he ceaſes to be their Officer; but what, is he now an Officer to other Churches?</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> If the with-drawing their ſubjection, and rejecting be ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regular, then though they make him not their Officer <hi>de facto,</hi> [which he is ſtill <hi>de jure</hi>] yet his relation to the Church-Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick viſible doth ſtill hold, and another Church giving him a Call, he hath then power <hi>actu ſecund<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
               </hi> to adminiſter the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances there.</p>
            <p>For inſtance, the ſeparatiſts caſt off him, whom before they choſe for their Officer, ſuppoſing now, unleſſe he will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce his ordination he is no Miniſter, doth he therefore ceaſe to be a Miniſter? how bufie ſome Congregationall Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches are in with-drawing from their Officers, it is too mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, and many goe to the <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> ſome turne <hi>Seekers,</hi> and-if all the Members doe thus, doe they now ceaſe to be Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters?</p>
            <p n="2">2 But if the with-drawing be regular, the cauſe juſt, tried, &amp;c. then that which is ſufficient ground for their with-draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from him, is juſt cauſe, why he ſhould be excommunicated, being pertinaciouſly ſcandalous, or Hereticall, as Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi>
               <pb n="70" facs="tcp:117994:42"/>ſuppoſeth. If then the caſe of a Church be ſo, as they are caſt by providence into ſome remote place, where are no Churches beſides to combine with, then as their election of him, &amp;c. [as I ſaid before] may ſupply the want of ordination; ſo this with-drawing in ſuch an extraordinary caſe may be <hi>Analogum</hi> to excommunication; but (ſay our Divines) if that Church be in combination with other Churches, as now under a <hi>Claſſis,</hi> then the people ſhall not need to ſtay there, in their with-draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but the caſe being judged and tryed by the <hi>Claſſis,</hi> they as they ordained him, when the people elected him [the people conſenting] doe excommunicate him; then as a man caſt out of one Church, is caſt out from the Catholick Church viſible; ſo he who is caſt out from being an Officer to this Church, is caſt out from being a Miniſter to the Church-Catholicke vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible.</p>
            <p>For the other Argument,
<note place="margin">Burro. I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren. p. 50 Nort. reſp. ad Apoll. p. 76, 78</note> the <hi>people conveying of power to an Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer;</hi> I know of no power the people conveyes, only a deſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of ſuch a perſon to officiate in this or that Society; but their power they receive from Chriſt immediatly (as our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregationall men affirme) and hence they act in his Name, not in the name of the Church.</p>
            <p n="5">5 The laſt anſwer I would give to this Propoſall is this; if you conceive this to be the only way of Reformation, then you muſt give the Miniſters ſtrong proofe that <hi>you may ordaine;</hi> the Miniſters will as much queſtion your power to ordaine, as you queſtion the Biſhops power; ſo that we take it for granted you are able to prove this, becauſe you are ſo punctuall, you ſay, for reforming by the word. But of this practiſe I much doubt.</p>
            <p n="1">1 My ground is, becauſe I finde not one <hi>Iota</hi> of any ſuch thing in the New Teſtament.</p>
            <p>Obj. <hi>Though you doe not in the New Teſtament, yet in the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment there is,</hi> Numb. 8.10.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> That place is the only reſuge, but</p>
            <p n="1">1 It is commonly anſwered, That it is no faire arguing to goe to the Old Teſtament for one thing we would have, and when another comes to the ſame Politie for an argument for their turne, now to debarre them, and tell them this is the old Politie; either leave out the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Politie altogether, or elſe give others leave to fetch Arguments from thence, as well as your ſelves.</p>
            <pb n="71" facs="tcp:117994:42"/>
            <p n="2">2 If you will goe to that Politie, why may I not as well prove, That the Civill Magiſtrate may ordaine, as well as <hi>Moſes</hi> did <hi>Aaron,</hi> Levit. 8.?</p>
            <p n="3">3 But in that Church at that time there were Officers, <hi>Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron</hi> and his ſonnes, thence (if that be a rule) it muſt follow, that though there be Officers in a Church, yet the people may ordaine, which I am ſure thoſe Divines, who are for the peoples power in ordination, will never admit, being croſſe to their owne Principles, and Scripture.</p>
            <p n="4">4 We finde in the eleventh verſe, that after that was done, Aaron <hi>did wave theſe Levites before the Lord,</hi> ſo that they were not compleat till <hi>Aaron</hi> had done his Act; whence I remember learned Maſter <hi>Cotton</hi> (in his diſcourſe with me) ſaid, the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples <gap reason="foreign">

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>: this clauſe only I remember, but he had a larger anſwer, which I tooke from him in diſcourſe, by which, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, he did enervate this Objection, but I loſt his notes, with all my other helps, in my ſhipwrack.</p>
            <p>Theſe men call for precept and example, give you us one for this in the New Teſtament, for you put us to that alſo, we muſt give you them out of the New Teſtament; yea, Iwould goe further, and deſire them to give me one examplein the firſt ſix hundred yeares after Chriſt, that ever the people did ordaine their Miniſter; now this is ſtrange to me, that we can finde no foot-ſtep of any ſuch thing in the Scripture, nor in the Ages next, and yet that we ſhould make it ſo frequent, that they muſt ordaine moſt frequently; for if every particular Church be Independent (as now ſuch a Church where I am in a ſmall Village, where the maintenance will not keep one Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, and therefore to be ſure we cannot have more Miniſters) then if the Miniſter remove, or dye, if there come a new Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, the people muſt ever ordaine, thus it muſt be in moſt places in <hi>England,</hi> few will be excepted;
<note place="margin">Iuſtin. Mart. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pol. 2</note> and if every new election muſt have a new ordination, then it muſt alwayes be in the peoples power; In the Primitive times, there were Churches in Cities, and Villages, but that the Chriſtians in Villages did ordaine their Officers, I would gladly ſee that proved.</p>
            <p>Ordination in thoſe times was carried by a continued ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, the Apoſtles ordained ſome Miniſters, thoſe ordained o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,

            <p n="1">1 To <hi>Reforme</hi> the Miniſter, is to <hi>Forme it</hi> now as it was firſt <hi>formed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the Miniſtry was not at firſt <hi>formed</hi> by the people, <hi>ergo</hi> the Miniſtry cannot be now <hi>reformed</hi> by the people.</p>
            <p>I thinke the Major will not be denyed, for the Minor, let any prove that. According to this ſome will ſay, We muſt have Apoſtles, they formed the Miniſters firſt [we ſpeake of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination] I ſay, <hi>Non ſequitur,</hi> unleſſe you can prove the Apoſtles ordained only <hi>quâ</hi> Apoſtles; if ſo, I know not how thoſe Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, whom the Apoſtles did ordaine, could ordaine others, but to be ſure they did.</p>
            <p n="2">2 I defire a text of Scripture that holds out this, <hi>that the people may ordaine in a generall Apoſtaſie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3 I doubt we ſhall rarely finde ſuch times, when there is a Society of godly Chriſtians to ordaine, but there is ſome Miniſters alſo; ordinarily there are Miniſters who teach this people.</p>
            <p n="4">4 It will be a queſtion, Whether the Apoſtaſie hath been ſuch as to require this, for if Baptiſme was not repeated, but was thought valid, though adminiſtred by a <hi>Romiſh</hi> Miniſter, becauſe he was ſet apart to the worke, and kept the eſſence of the ordinance, why might not the ordination adminiſtred by thoſe Miniſters hold as well?</p>
            <p n="2">2 A ſecond ground that makes me doubt is this, it ſeemes ſtrange to me, that Chriſt ſhould appoint extraordinary officers,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:117994:43"/>and make that a part of their work, which the people themſelves may doe; <hi>Paul</hi> leaves <hi>Titus</hi> to ordaine, but what needs that? the people might well ſay, what need <hi>Paul</hi> leave <hi>Titus</hi> to do that, which we can doe our ſelves? <hi>Fruſtra fit per plura,</hi> &amp;c. the Apoſtles never needed but to preach, and convert the people to the faith, when they had done ſo, they ſhould have ſaid, <hi>we have now done our worke, brought you to be beleevers, you may now elect an Officer, and ordaine him your ſelves, the power is yours,</hi> (onely here would have been ſome trouble about baptizing) ſince then I finde, that this was part of thier Office, then I cannot beleeve this is the peoples worke. <hi>Paul</hi> might eaſily have left us a preſident in ſome Society of Chriſtians, that would have quieted all our diſputes.</p>
            <p>More might be ſaid (and is ſaid by others) but I ſee our <hi>New Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> Divines do almoſt yeeld it, by giving power to ſome Miniſters to ordaine in other Congregations.</p>
            <p>Since nothing can be drawn from Scripture, by precept, or example to prove this, hence ſome would draw it out by Argument.</p>
            <p>Thoſe who can do the greater, may doe the leſſe.</p>
            <p>The people can doe the greater, viz. <hi>elect.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ergo,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The minor is as freely denyed, as it is affirmed, <hi>election</hi> is not the greater, Scripture-light being judge. That was the deſigne I doubt of making <hi>Ordination</hi> but an <hi>Adjunct,</hi> for ſo indeed it would eaſily bee granted, if election gives the eſſence, and this only be an adjunct, the people may well ordaine; Yea, and in a Church, where there are Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers to Ordaine, I know not why they, who give the <hi>eſſence</hi> may not give the <hi>adjunct,</hi> why ſhould an adjunct be proper to the Officers only in that Church, when the eſſence doth not belong to them,
<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>N. W. Omnis quaeſtio non per aliud quod quaeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur babebit reſolutio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem nec ambiguitas per ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guitatem, ſed ex elaris manifestis, &amp;c. Irenae</hi> l. 2. c. 10.</note> further then as members, they joyne with the people? for ſo it ſeemes the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers elect as members, and if you doe elect only as members, why ſhould you not alſo ordaine as members? for election is the greater, this the leſſe.</p>
            <p>The other Argument is, the people are the <hi>firſt ſubject of the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the keyes. Ergo:</hi> But this is not eaſily yeelded; it was a witty ſpeech of him, <hi>Let the Elders keep the keyes, and the people the key<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clog;</hi> it proves ſo too often. What our Divines have ſaid about it is well knowne. I thinke they have battered this notion pretty well.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſometime is quoted for this opinion, but I am confident it was never in <hi>Auguſtines</hi> thoughts; In <hi>Evan. Joan. Tract.</hi> 50. <hi>Tract.</hi> 124. I am miſtaken, if he be not rather for the Catholick Church
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:117994:44"/>by his words eſpecially in the latter place quoted, not mentioning what other Divines have ſpoken, there are two or three things that have made me doubt of this, ſo as I never did throughly cloſe with this no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when I was but a private member of a Church.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That which is the <hi>primum ſubjectum,</hi> is the <hi>proprium ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectum:</hi> none doubt of this, <hi>Proprium ſubjectum eſt quod cum ſuo accidente reciprocatur. Animal eſt proprium ſubjectum ſenſus, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo riſus,</hi> hence we ſay, <hi>omnis homo eſt riſibilis, &amp; omne riſibile eſt homo,</hi> this is <hi>Axioma</hi>

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> doth include in it the rule <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, where the predicate is true <hi>de omni ſubjecto, omni loco, omni tempore,</hi> this is true of <hi>animal &amp; ſenſus.</hi> So it muſt be true of the power of the keyes and the Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity, <hi>Omni tempore;</hi> but if we finde the power of the keyes exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed before there was a Fraternity, then there was ſome other ſubject before the Fraternity; When <hi>Paul</hi> came to <hi>Corinth,</hi> he preached <hi>Authoritativè, Ergo</hi> there was the power of the keyes in ſome ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, but the Fratemity was <hi>Non-ens</hi> at this time, how then could they be the ſubject?</p>
            <p>Thoſe, who are the effect of the power of the keyes, are not the firſt ſubject, that is clear.</p>
            <p>But the Fraternity is the effect; it was ſo in all the Churches, which the Apoſtles gathered, and is indeed to this day. This was one Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment troubled me.</p>
            <p>So that which is <hi>primum,</hi> is <hi>immediatum ſubjectum:</hi> but how can this be? ſince <hi>Mediantibus Apoſtolis,</hi> and ſo now <hi>Mediantibus Miniſtris</hi> the Fraternity is made: The elector is before the elected: its true of Chriſt, who elected the Apoſtles, and gave to them the keyes, from whom by a continued ſucceſſion of Miniſters ſtill the Fratemity was made; but had not the power of the keyes had ſome effect, there had not been a Fraternity to chooſe an Officer: though they are now in time before him, whom they now elect, yet they were not before him or them <hi>[quâ fratres]</hi> who by the power of the keyes in the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry made them capable to chooſe an Officer; therefore the power of the keyes was in ſome ſubject before them.</p>
            <p>Beſides election is no part of the power of the keyes,
<note place="margin">Doma: log. p. 461. Keckes. ſyſt: log. l. 2. c. 20.</note> therefore to argue, the people elect, <hi>ergo</hi> they are the firſt ſubject, &amp;c. is <hi>fallacia non cauſae procanſâ [cauſae nomen hic uſurpat ur pro quo vis argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mento]</hi> taking that to be a part of the power which is not.</p>
            <p n="2">2 If ſo, that which is <hi>primum, est abſolutum ſubjectum, cui ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidens abſolutè ſint ulla limitatione partis inharet: ſic animal eſt
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:117994:44"/>abſolutum ſubjectum ſenſus, adeoque viſus &amp; auditus; ideoque tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum animal dicitur rectê videre &amp; audire: oculus non videt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priè, quia non eſt Animal: quando ergo oculus dicitur videre, id non ſubjectivè intelligendum eſt, ſed inſtrumentaliter, quod animal videat per oculum.</hi> To apply this to our caſe, the power of the keyes is in the whole body, ſo the power of preaching &amp;c. there is the power <hi>ſubjectivè &amp; propriè;</hi> ſo that if we aske who preached to day, we muſt anſwer, properly and ſubjectively the people preached, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumentally only the Paſtor preached; ſo for the adminiſtration of the Sacraments, this is very harſh; hence againe, becauſe <hi>animal videt,</hi> if a man dye, or beaſt, the eye which was the inſtrument of ſeeing, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting it may be the diſſipation of the animal ſpirits, elſe as an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, it remains intire in the coates, humors and optick nerves, but yet it ſees not.</p>
            <p>So it ſeemes a Miniſter, in caſe his body, the people, ſhould dye, he being but the inſtrument of their preaching, he can preach no more: this is ſtrange; how doe they preach out of their own bodies ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly? If the men dye, and only women and children be left, the officer hath loſt his preaching, and cannot preach to them authoritatively, becauſe the Fraternity, in whom the power was <hi>ſubjectivè,</hi> is dead.</p>
            <p n="3">3 I have obſerved, that ſeven have been eſteemed enough to make a Church; ſuppoſe now one of theſe ſhould offend another of the ſeven, he muſt deale with him, if he will not heare, he muſt take two more, here are four of the ſeven, if he will not hear them, <hi>tell the Church,</hi> that is, the three left, the reſt are parties.</p>
            <p>Some to prove that <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. <hi>To thee I give the Keyes,</hi> muſt be meant the Fraternity, ſay, that <hi>To Thee,</hi> here is the ſame with <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.</p>
            <p>But this is ſomewhat doubted, for that in <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. may well bee meant of a particular Church,
<note place="margin">The viſible Church is here meant ſaith Mr. <hi>Hoober</hi> Sur. p. 278.</note> but in this place the Church muſt bee meant of the Catholike viſible Church: for it muſt be ſuch a Church as muſt not faile.</p>

            <pb n="76" facs="tcp:117994:45"/>
            <p>Mr.
<note place="margin">Vind. vin. p. 6.</note> 
               <hi>Cawdry</hi> upon that Text ſeemes to have a good Argument, <q>ſince that the Kingdome of Heaven is there meant the Church, the keyes are given to <hi>Peter</hi> as diſtinguiſhed from the Church; It is not a reaſonable conſtruction (ſaith he) of the Text to ſay, I give to thee the keyes of the Kingdome of Heaven, that is, of the Church, and to mean, I give to the Church the keyes of the Church; whence he concludes, they were given to <hi>Peter,</hi> and ſo to the Officers for the Church, as the keyes are given to the Steward for the family.</q> This Argument is worth the Anſwering.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> The ſtrongeſt Objection to mee is this, the firſt ſubject takes up the whole adjunct, for there is a reciprocation; therefore the Presbytery cannot be the firſt ſubject, for the keyes are not reciproca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with them; inſtance is given in Election, Admiſſion of Members, Diſcipline, which cannot be performed without the Fraternity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> If reciprocation be ſo required, &amp;c. then this will as well deny the people to bee firſt ſubject, for reciprocation cannot bee with them; for Preaching, Adminiſtration of Sacraments, Government &amp;c. to be ſure the people cannot doe; there will be more ſaid for the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery; they actually <hi>chooſe,</hi> they actually <hi>admit,</hi> they actually <hi>govern</hi> and exerciſe diſcipline, they have both the Power and the Act: but for the people they cannot doe any Act which belongs to the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, nor have ſo much as the power of it: we may ſee by this, where the power will cheifly reſide: to ſay, the Fraternity, though they have not officiall power, yet they have power to chuſe an Officer, and ſo conſequently, they are the firſt ſubject, this is very unſatisfactory, to have the Adjunct reciprocated at the ſecond hand, it being denyed before that they have the Adjunct; the reciprocation betweene <hi>homo &amp; animal riſibile</hi> is not at ſecond hand</p>
            <p n="2">2 This doth not at all ſhake me, but I ſtand on my ground ſtill, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving, that the <hi>Church or ganized is the firſt ſubject of the power of the Keyes,</hi> not that I make the people equall ſharers in the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the keyes with the Officers, but what I mean I ſhall expreſſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Yet am I not ſatisfied (nor could ever be) that whatever belongs to the Church muſt needs be included in the power of the keyes; E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, I look at it only as <hi>Potest as circa claves,</hi> but not to be a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of them.</p>
            <p>The Text tells us the uſe of them, what thou <hi>bindeſt,</hi> what thou <hi>looſeſt,</hi> to bind and to looſe is the uſe of them: but what is this to the election of an Officer? when as hee may refuſe their Call, or the Call
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:117994:45"/>of any Church? how doe they looſe him or bind him? <hi>Electio non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cogit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the other two things, <hi>Admiſſion,</hi> and <hi>Diſcipline:</hi> Thoſe Divines, who ſay, <hi>that Baptiſme makes men Members of the Church,</hi> if they can prove this ſtrongly, they will carry away the former, <hi>ſcil.</hi> that the people have nothing to do in Admiſſion of mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, for baptiſme makes members; now to this I cannot yet fully agree, there might be much ſaid for the contrary. I conceive the <hi>New England</hi> Divines have ſpoken well to this beſides the opinion of M. <hi>Cartwright,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Anſ to 32. Qu. p. 12.</note> and <hi>Ames,</hi> who joyn with them.</p>
            <p>So, thoſe Divines who affirme the Presbytery may excommunicate, <hi>renitente plebe,</hi> if they can prove it ſtrongly, they will carry away the latter, and then indeed its cleare, the people have no intereſt in the power of the keyes; but this neither can be admitted, and the ſtreame of Divines oppoſe this.</p>
            <p>But though I yeeld the Miniſtry cannot orderly doe theſe things without the people, yet I deny the people do theſe things in the ſame way and order, that the Miniſtry doth them: And therefore <hi>Quaere,</hi> Whether it be proper to ſay, the people hath any power of the keyes?</p>
            <p>For Admiſſions, this will be more troubleſome, becauſe we finde no examples of the Churches where the people did ſhew their power in Admiſſions: for that act of <hi>Paul, Act</hi> 9.26, 27. Whether it be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to prove it, I leave it to conſideration; they did not admit, why? <hi>they were afraid of him,</hi> the text ſaith, being a perſecutor, then no wonder the Apoſtles, as well as the people, were afraid of him; the 27 verſe ſaith, <hi>Barnabas</hi> carried <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> not to the <hi>people,</hi> which would imply, the Apoſtles carryed the ſtroke in Admiſſions.</p>
            <p>Further to ſearch into this, let us ſuppoſe the Miniſtry of the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> preach, an Infidell heare them, the man is ſo far convinced of the vanity of his Heatheniſm, and danger of his ſinful luſts he wallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in, and ſo far convinced of the neceſſity of that Doctrine which he heares, that he renounces his Idols, reforms his converſation, &amp;c. now he comes to the Miniſters to ſignifie what is done, and what he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, to be received into the Church, and be baptized, being willing to give up himſelfe to that doctrine: the Miniſtry [inſtrumentally] hath wrought this; now what power hath the people here to hinder this man? is it at their choyce whether they will admit him or no? when the Officers ſee what effect the preaching hath had, here being a <hi>Diſciple</hi> made, ſhal they be hindred from baptizing him? what power
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:117994:46"/>have the people here? what ſhall they goe firſt and examine him? I know not where examination was ever given to the people; muſt he make his profeſſion of faith before all the Church, as <hi>Victorinus</hi> that brave <hi>Rhetorician?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Aug. Con feſ. l: 8. c: 2.</note> we find it was not their courſe to doe ſo with all thoſe whom they admitted, for many did onely to the <hi>Presbyters:</hi> This power indeed the brethren have, that if any know this man to live in a known way of wickedneſſe, that cannot poſſibly ſtand with any hopes of faith, to come and give in witneſſe againſt ſuch a perſon to the Officers: I ſuppoſe this will be yeelded, and the Officers would not now baptize him. But what power more they have, I know not; they ſee his converſation, and can teſtifie of that, but it were ſtrange that it ſhould be left to the peoples choyce, whether they will admit a man or not, when the word hath had ſo much power, and they cannot bring in ſufficient objections to the contrary. Put caſe the major part of the members of the Church had drunk in ſome errors [that a major part may do ſo, hath been proved in our time] and they will not give their conſent to the admiſſion of the man, if they finde him not of their opinion [commonly thoſe who have drunke in error, uſe to look un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>towardly upon thoſe who are contrary] now the Miniſters have no power to admit this man, nor baptize him, though they ſee he hath right to it. But I leave that.</p>
            <p>For Diſcipline, I conceive <hi>renitente plebe,</hi> the Elderſhip ſhould not excommunicate: it is in vaine to doe ſo indeed, if the people will hold communion: but yet this doth not argue that the people doe here act, as doth the Elderſhip; For the Elderſhip doth it <hi>Authoritativè,</hi> the people by a <hi>popular conſenting</hi> with the Officers, that the perſon bee excommunicate: the people doe act here <hi>obedientially</hi> to their Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, therefore a vaſte difference is betweene them. I remember a paſſage of Mr. <hi>Hookers</hi> in the Aſſembly of Divines; <hi>When a caſe is brought to the Elders, the Elders having ſearched all things to the bottome, now the Elders bring the caſe to the Fraternity, and lay it down clear before them, this is the caſe, and this ought to be done, now</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>the people are bound to obey us, as well as when wee preach.</hi> And it is cleare, for as in preaching they diſcover the minde of God, ſo in this ſentence they declare the ſame concerning this act.
<note place="margin">Keyes 15</note> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.6. <hi>We have in readineſſe to revenge all diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, when your obedience is fulfilled.</hi> Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> ſaith, <q>the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles revenge of diſobedience by way of reproofe in preaching, doth not follow the peoples obedience, but proceedeth, whether the people obey or not; it was therefore their revenge by way of cenſure in Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:117994:46"/>which they had in readines, when the obedience of the Church is fulfilled in diſcerning and approving the equity of the Cenſure, which the Apoſtle, or Elders have declared to them from the word.</q>
            </p>
            <p>That phraſe, <hi>diſcerning and approving of the equity,</hi> needs a little more clearing; but I leave them: However this Reverend Divine ſeems to refer that obedience unto <hi>the wil of Chriſt,</hi> by the words go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before his expoſition, yet that hinders not, but it may in ſome ſence be applyed to their officers [who alſo obey Chriſt] for that phraſe is not ſtrange to have people obey their officers, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.17. <hi>O bey your Rulers,</hi> there may be ſome thing in it, not only obey your Teachers, but Rulers; when they rule, as when they preach, Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> expreſſing,
<note place="margin">Reſp. ad Apol. p. 67.</note> as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, how the brethren act with the Elderſhip [for ſo I remember it was in his Tables which I had, &amp; had ſome thoughts to have Printed them, but in that great fire, when <hi>Colcheſter</hi> was beſiedged (having lent them to a friend) they were burnt, as I heare) <hi>Partes judicii in rebus juriſdictionis, quales ſunt fratrum examinatio, dijudicatio &amp; ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiatio Cauſae per modum obedientiae, Presbyterio debitae,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.16. <hi>&amp; cap.</hi> 2.9.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mr. Gilleſpie,</hi> alſo beſides his own opinion giveth reaſons,
<note place="margin">Aar. rod, p. 289, &amp;c.</note> and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth <q>divers Divines, who interpret this place of Church cenſures: &amp; theſe words, <hi>when your obedience is fulfilled,</hi> gives him one ground for his interpretation: for as <hi>Eſtius</hi> and <hi>Novarinus</hi> explain the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles reaſon, it is in vain to excommunicate all ſuch as are worthy of excommunication,</q> when there is a generall renitency in the Church: but ſtill we obſerve the people act obedientially to their officers, that they did not at that time, was their fault.</p>
            <p>Beſides, if excommunication be the higheſt act of Rule, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot be performed where Rulers are not, as ſaith Mr. <hi>Cotton:</hi> and if a homogeneall body can expreſſe no ſpirituall Juriſdiction, but onely withdraw, as ſaith Maſter <hi>Burroughs,</hi> then the people hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Rulers, are not now made Rulers, nor have the power of juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction; there is indeed juriſdiction exerciſed among them by reaſon of their Rulers, to whom they conſent and obey.</p>
            <p>Government is proper to the Presbytery, ſaith acute Mr. <hi>Norton,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Reſp: ad Apol. p: 65 67:</note> and ſhewes under ſeven particulars how the Presbyters governe in Church affairs, and ſo in this exerciſe of Diſcipline: if ſo, then the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are governed in this act; how then doth a people <hi>governed,</hi> act in reference to Rulers <hi>governing,</hi> but by way of obedience? So that to mee there appeares a vaſte difference betweene the power
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:117994:47"/>of Diſcipline, as it is in the hands of the Presbytery, and as in the hands of the people, though the Miniſters cannot excommunicate with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the people.</p>
            <p>I ſpeake a few words to this point here, becauſe I would ſpare the labour in another place.</p>
            <p>As for the Analogy drawne from the <hi>civill power, the people are the firſt ſubject of civill power; Ergo</hi> the <hi>Fraternity is the firſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of Church power;</hi> For the Antecedent I leave that, but the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence I ſhould deny, there is a great diſproportion.</p>
            <p>Firſt, The People are not the effect of their Magiſtrates, or follow after them (as the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were not of <hi>Saul</hi>) but the Fraternity, <hi>quâ ſic,</hi> is the effect of the Miniſtry: The Apoſtles converted, and after them the Miniſters converted; Converting is but to make the people ſuch, for whom the power of the keyes is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven:</p>
            <p>Secondly, There is ſome thing in this; In Corporations, if the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple have elected a man to be an Alderman, or Mayor, if he refuſe it, there is a Fine ſet upon him; ſome have been fined 20 li. ſome more according as the Corporations are: but if the body of the people will chooſe an Officer, and he will refuſe it, what then? I know no kind of Church act that reaches him: this ſhewes there is ſomething more in civill then Church power,</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The people do give to their Magiſtrates a power to make Lawes, &amp;c. for their good; but the Church gives no power into the hands of her Miniſters, but they have all their power immediately from Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Hence the people may limit their people, or inlarge it: But the people cannot limit, nor inlarge the power the Miniſters have.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, We ſee the Magiſtrates Act in the name of the people <hi>[in the name of the Commonwealth of England]</hi> but Miniſters doe not act in the name of the <hi>Church,</hi> but <hi>Chriſt;</hi> as ſaith Mr. <hi>Burroughs</hi> and <hi>Mr. Norton</hi> before quoted.</p>
            <p>More might be produced, but I content my ſelfe with theſe; and though that maxime be received, <hi>Salus populi, Suprema lex,</hi> yet it hinders not but the people may ſave themſelves, though they be not the <hi>firſt ſubject</hi> of the keyes. <hi>Mr. Richardſon,</hi> whom <hi>Dr. Ames</hi> and <hi>Mr.
<note place="margin">Manuſcr: Tables.</note> Hooker,</hi> honoured much, and follow much, placeth the power of <hi>binding,</hi> and <hi>looſing</hi> in the Governours, not in the people.</p>
            <p>This diſcourſe I have runne into by anſwering to the firſt Propoſall,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:117994:47"/>which being the maine, I have beſtowed more lines about it; the reſt I ſhall run over quickly. Come we now to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Propoſall may be this;
<note place="margin">The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſall. No Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregational Divine dares put the forme of a Church in the <hi>expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citeneſſe</hi> of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, but theſe doe. Survey, pare firſt, p. 47, 48.</note> 
               <hi>Wee would have an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicite Covenant in every particular Church, this we judge to be the forme of a Church, and we cannot joyne with a Church without it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Many people have taken up this by the end, a <hi>Covenant is the forme of a Church,</hi> underſtanding it of an <hi>explicite</hi> Covenant, but they know not what a <hi>Forme</hi> is; if they did, they would be more wary then they are. But let us heare what Congregatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall men ſay, from whom you take up this word.</p>
            <p n="1">1 Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> ſaith, an implicite Covenant preſerves the true nature of the true Church, &amp;c. and an implicite Covenant is, when in their practiſe they doe that, whereby they make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ingaged to walke in ſuch a ſociety, according to ſuch rules of government, which are exerciſed amongſt them, and ſo ſubmit themſelves thereunto, but doe not make any verball profeſſion thereof. Thus the people in the Pariſhes in <hi>England,</hi> when there is a Miniſter put upon them by the Patron, or Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, they conſtantly hold them to the fellowſhip of the people in ſuch a place, attend all the Ordinances there uſed, and the Diſpenſations of the Miniſter ſo impoſed upon them, &amp;c. by ſuch actions, they declare that by their practiſes, which others hold forth by publick profeſſion; thus farre Mr. <hi>Hooker,</hi> ſo Mr. <hi>Norton,</hi> Reſp. ad Apollon. p. 22.28. ſo the Confeſſion of Church Diſc. by the Synod of <hi>New England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2 You have a Nationall Covenant, a ſolemne one, I thinke it is ſtrong enough if you obſerve it well: there is that which an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers the Covenants you finde made in Scripture.</p>
            <p>To ſay, by that we are made a Nationall Church; this were very ſilly, yet I thinke there may be ſo much ſaid for a Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Church that will not readily be anſwered. But ſuppoſe the Churches in <hi>New England</hi> [which God forbid] ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline, &amp;c. If the <hi>Generall Court</hi> ſhould make ſuch a Covenant to paſſe through all the Churches in the Colony, would it make a Nationall Church? they would conceive their Churches ſtill to be Congregationall.</p>
            <p n="3">3 I make no doubt but you ſhould have found (if you had but a little patience) that when the Miniſters had come to ſet up Diſcipline, they would have brought their people under
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:117994:48"/>ſome ſtricter tye, to ſubject to Church Diſcipline, I have heard ſome ſpeake of it; they would have found it too laxe, that implicite conſent to make people put in execution that, <hi>Matth.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Read his firſt chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, in ſome Churches he ſaith, there was <hi>Solennis proteſtatio ſubjection is, ſub diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliná Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticâ. p.</hi> 13.</note> 18.15, 16, &amp;c. as ſome have found before them; and it was not without ſome cauſe that <hi>Apollonius</hi> ſets downe that, as one thing that is required of a Church-Member, and whom they will admit to the Lords Supper, <hi>That he ſhall promiſe to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject himſelfe to Diſcipline;</hi> he tells us, thus it was concluded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in ſeverall Synods, he mentions fix Synods. I have found the experience of this ſo already, that I ſhould thinke my ſelfe in a poore caſe to exerciſe Diſcipline without it; the people feele ſome ſtricter tye upon their ſpirits, and I thanke God I have knowne good effects by it.</p>
            <p n="4">4 If you will needs goe cloſer doe, you may enter into a cloſe Covenant, as did thoſe worthy Chriſtians in <hi>Wetherfield,</hi> in that old Prophets dayes, who ſets downe their Covenant in his ſeven Treatiſes; but they did not ſeparate as you doe. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell thoſe Chriſtians if you can.</p>
            <p>The third Propoſall;
<note place="margin">The third Propoſall.</note> 
               <hi>We would have no Church-Members but vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Saints.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> This were a thing to be wiſhed indeed, and that I beleeve which the Miniſters would be glad, if they could attaine it; I gave you inſtances before out of their Bookes, and it is that which they would put forth their power to effect, ſo farre as the ſtate of the Kingdome is capable of, if once they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted with power to exerciſe Diſcipline; and indeed as the condition of <hi>England</hi> ſtands, there is need of a Civill Power to back them; the caſe is not now, as in the Primitive times.</p>
            <p n="2">2 You muſt put a difference between Churches new erecting, and theſe in <hi>England,</hi> which have been Churches ſo long; when I raiſe a houſe new from the ground, I may then doe as I pleaſe, but if I be mending of an old houſe, I muſt doe as well as I can, repaire by degrees.</p>
            <p n="3">3 What would you have done with all the reſt, Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate them? that's a peece of work indeed; and beſides, there is a great deale of worke to doe before we come to that, it may be many will not be found contumacious; nay you ſee, they doe ſeparate them from the Lords Supper, and divers begin to looke ſomething more narrowly to baptiſme.</p>
            <p n="4">4 How many corrupt Members doe you finde in the Church
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:117994:48"/>of <hi>Corinth</hi> and <hi>Galatia?</hi> for the latter, what a change was there made in their affections towards <hi>Paul?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gilleſp.

<note place="margin">Aar. rod, 289.</note> 
               <hi>Paul</hi> indeed ſaith, he wil not <hi>ſpare</hi> them. This place Maſter <hi>Gilleſpie</hi> thinkes gives light to, <hi>Ch.</hi> 10. &amp; 6. <hi>When your obedience is fulfilled;</hi> our Miniſters debarreſuch from the Supper.</p>
            <p n="5">5 If you did not thus ſeparate from them, they might doe more towards the reforming of their Congregations, but you weaken their hands, as I ſhall touch hereafter.</p>
            <p n="6">6 But what doe you meane by <hi>viſible Saints,</hi> what is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, or how would you judge of one? what, would you have them reall Saints?

            <p n="2">2 When there are Members to be admitted, who never were Church-Members, you ſhall finde it granted, but that is not our caſe here; if you would have power in admiſſion to Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, you have that liberty given you, to bring in Teſtimonie for, or againſt; and if you bring in ſufficient proofes againſt perſons, you ſhall finde they ſhall not be admitted; thus muſt you doe in any Church what-ever. If any good Chriſtian ſhall come, and give in teſtimony for another, the Miniſter will gladly receive it.</p>
            <p>For <hi>Excommunication,</hi> the Presbyteriall Miniſters will not Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate without the peoples conſent; you ſhall have li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty [firſt asking leave of the Miniſter, who is the Ruler, and Mouth of the Congregation] to propound any queſtion ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly, and gravely, which you would have cleared, before you manifeſt your conſent, if there be any thing darke to you, that ſo you may clearly obey them [for I hope you doe not looke to be equall with Officers in this Act] and I hope this is more then ever you ſaw practiſed in old times. Now that the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters will not Act againſt the people [I ſuppoſe they meane the Body of the People, for if they meane, unleſſe all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple conſent, I would not conſent to the Presbyteriall Miniſters in this, that ſome few particular perſons, guilty it may be themſelves in ſome degree, ſhall obſtruct the ſentence, when the ſounder and major part of the Church conſents] heare their owne words.</p>

Of the Congregationall Divines I finde two men of no ſmall worth, who though in ſome extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:117994:49"/>caſe in places where Miniſters are not to be had, if there be any able Chriſtian fit to ſpeake, they would grant ſuch a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty in a regular way; but for the places you bring to prove that it is an Ordinance of Chriſt for private members to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie,
<note place="margin">Keys 20.</note> they oppoſe this: Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> ſaith, <hi>That place</hi> 1 Cor.
<note place="margin">Reſp. ad Apol. p. 125.</note> 14.31. <hi>doth not ſpeake of ordinary private members, but of men furniſhed with extraordinary gifts,</hi> he proves it afterward. Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> ſaith, <hi>Propheſie, concerning which Paul ſpeaks,</hi> 1 Cor. 14. <hi>is not to be underſtood of any ordinary and perpetuall gift whatever, much leſſe of an ordinary and perpetuall gift of private brethren,</hi> and that he proves.</p>
            <p>I intend not to lanch forth Into this Controverſie, for others have anſwered all thoſe arguments that are brought; but let me ſay this, When I conſidered theſe places, 1 Cor. 12.28. <hi>God hath ſet ſome in the Church, firſt Apoſtles, ſecondarily Prophets, thirdly Teachers.</hi> The 29. verſe, <hi>Are all Apoſtles? are all Prophets? are all Teachers?</hi> In the ſame order he reckons them. So Epheſ. 4.11. <hi>He gave ſome Apoſtles, ſome Prophets, &amp;c.</hi> So Act. 13. 1. <hi>There was in the Church at Antioch certaine Prophets and Teachers, as Barnabas, &amp;c.</hi> Prophets have ever their place next Apoſtles, and are ranked before Teachers; theſe texts are to me ſtrong proofes, that theſe Prophets were no ſuch private men as ours, nor their gifts ordinary; thoſe that would be ſuch muſt needs take place of their officers, you are before them, for theſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets are alwayes placed before ordinary officers. That 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.2. and 14. v. 22.30. theſe places wel conſidered will prove it was no ordinary gift.</p>
            <p>But I would leave that way of arguing? and would argue againſt it from what I have obſerved about it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is needleſſe, what need is there of it? I have obſerved that the ordinary time when theſe Prophets goe to worke, is after the Miniſters have done preaching: what need is there of theſe men now to goe to Propheſying? why doe they not goe home and meditate upon the Sermons they have heard, and call them over in their families? but (for ſooth) now the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren muſt goe to Propheſie.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is not onely needleſſe, but it is dangerous, Satan hath a deſigne in it.</p>
            <p>Firſt, to undermine the power of the word preached, theſe perſons who have heard two Sermons before, run now to Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſying,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:117994:50"/>where is the word the people heard before?

            <p>Secondly, his deſigne is to blaſt the <hi>Miniſters,</hi> for I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, Miniſters, nor their preaching is in any requeſt with this generation, and the people are more taken with their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſying, being a pretty new conceit, then they are with their officers preaching; be it never ſo ſolid.</p>
            <p>A neare friend of mine (yet living) a Divine well knowne travelling into <hi>Germany,</hi> coming home in <hi>Holland</hi> he went to heare Mr. <hi>Ainſworth,</hi> who preached a very ſtrong Sermon (the perſon was able to judge) while Mr. <hi>Ainſworth</hi> was preaching, my friend obſerved the carriage of his members, it was, he thought, not becoming the Ordinance (I will not write all he told me, left I ſhould be thought to write out of malice) very dull and dead that was the faireſt; when Mr. <hi>Ainſworth</hi> had done, they now were to propheſie; my friend ſaid he obſerved, that thoſe, who ſate ſo dully and unreverently, while their Paſtor was preaching very excellently, now their turne came to propheſie, roſe up, and were ſo perke and lively, that he could but note their carriage. The word preached by officers, though never ſo able, doth little good, where this trade is driven.</p>
            <p n="3">3. I have obſerved, order with peace and unity, is ſeldome or never kept, where theſe perſons flouriſh: one thinkes his parts are as good as his brothers; this man he carps, and findes fault with his brothers doctrine; then come differences in, and heart-burnings; this man would be thought to be the chiefe, and moſt called upon to exerciſe, another likes not that, jang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, diſcord, breaches, I have knowne to be the fruit of this good work.</p>
            <p n="4">4. I have rarely knowne any of theſe perſons that were humble men: the bones of pride, and ſelfe-conceitedneſſe have ſtucke out ſhamefully in the chiefe of thoſe, whom I have knowne; what others are, whom I have not knowne, I cannot tell, but the moſt gracious, ſavoury, humble perſons that I have knowne, though as able as thoſe who are ſo forward, yet they cannot be brought to this practice, but content themſelves in improving what talents they have otherwiſe.</p>
            <p n="5">5. I doe not finde private men to be ſo able, as theſe ſuppoſe themſelves to be; ſome particular perſons, Chriſtians of good
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:117994:50"/>experience, and ripe underſtandings, and ſome that are ſchol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars may be able to ſpeake to ſome points very well; but moſt what our Prophets deliver, either vile errours, as I have knowne, or elſe wrong the Scriptures very groſly many times:
<note place="margin">This man doth uſe to propheſie much, this is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable in him that he is adverſe to other er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours. I have known other Chriſtians beſides him, very eminent and ſound yet give groſſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of plaine Scripture.</note> One of late was handling that Text of <hi>Cornelius, Act.</hi> 10. that he was a <hi>devout man, prayed, gave almes, &amp;c.</hi> he caſt this gloſſe upon it, that <hi>Cornelius</hi> was but as our devout Papiſts, that uſe alſo to pray, and give almes; this is ſtrange that <hi>Cornelius</hi> was no other then ſuch a one, doth the Scripture ſet ſuch commendations upon ſuch a perſon? I doubt the man did not well know what it was to be <hi>devaut</hi> in Scripture account; the next words, <hi>fearing God,</hi> might have helped him to underſtand what manner of one he was. Being at <hi>London</hi> within leſſe then a yeare, I heard there was a meeting of Chriſtians, and the brethren were to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie, and it ſeems it was their manner to ſpeak <hi>ex tempore</hi> after the firſt had ſpoken; I ſuppoſe they would imitate that text, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.30. <hi>If any thing be revealed to another that ſitteth by, &amp;c.</hi> I had no great ſtomacke to goe, yet I thought I would go hear, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing that theſe perſons who cry up <hi>propheſying,</hi> had ſomething more excellent then other Miniſters, eſpecially being ſuch ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries to Black-coats: The text was 1 Theſ. 5. <hi>Quench not the Spirit;</hi> the next words, <hi>Deſpiſe not propheſying,</hi> were brought in be ſure, and charged home, that people ſhould obſerve that, as one way of <hi>quenching the Spirit,</hi> I beleeve they ſpake <hi>ex tempore: Learning,</hi> and <hi>Ordination</hi> they were cryed downe; the glorious new lights brought in by the <hi>illiterate</hi> men were cryed up; but ſuch a meſſe I had, that ſhould our poore Country Black-coats propheſie no better, we ſhould teach our people to <hi>deſpiſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſying.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe things I have obſerved in this new invented Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance: the ſumme is, when you bring us the men that are qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified for ſuch a worke (ſuch as that worthy and honourable man Mr. <hi>Winthrop,</hi> who was a ſolid man, a good ſchollar, and naturall Philoſopher, fitted to ſpeake excellently, and did ſometimes, before Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> went over to <hi>New England,</hi> when the officers deſired him, but I never heard whether he did, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> came) and can prove thoſe texts to be meant of ordinary gifts, and the Prophets to be perſons out of office, then we ſhall give you leave to Propheſie, but not after other Sermons preached by your officers.</p>

               <hi>Anſw.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iren. p. 30.</note> Mr. <hi>Burroughs</hi> ſaith, <hi>The Devill uſes to take ſanctuary in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, hoping there men will be tender; but enquiry is to be made, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he be indeed got in there, or in ſome other roome of the ſoule.</hi> What that worthy man hath ſpoken to this point, I refer the Reader to Chap. 6. of his <hi>Irenicum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Becauſe conſcience is ſo often pleaded, and made the <hi>Aſylum</hi> for every opinioniſt, let us ſearch when a man may be judged by Chriſtian rules to be ſwayed by conſcience.</p>
            <p>Firſt, I would looke that ſuch a man be one, that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the beſt obſervation that can be made of him, hath a <hi>renewed conſcience:</hi> I muſt finde him to be <hi>uniforme,</hi> elſe I weigh not what he ſaith about his conſcience. There will be infirmities, but then they are but infirmities, and thoſe truly lamented.</p>
            <p>Though a man have a renewed conſcience,
<note place="margin">Poſito ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracto &amp; concreto non statim ponitur modus a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendi.</note> yet I will not ſay that a true renewed conſcience is the cauſe why he main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines ſuch an opinion, he may not be rightly conſcientious in that.</p>
            <p>Secondly, ſuch a one is ready to give an account of his conſcience if you call him to it, if he will not give me a reaſon what moves his conſcience, I regard him no more: Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is but a Deputy, it cannot make Lawes, but they are made before.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, ſuch a man hath uſed all means, the beſt means he can, to find out Gods mind, prayer, reading, conferring with the ableſt Saints, and ſuch as have moſt skill to guide; yea, prayer and faſting, any way to finde out the truth his conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is troubled about: If he hath not uſed the beſt, and all means, I weigh not his plea of conſcience.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, if after ſearching he cannot yet come to ſee what the ſtreame of holy and learned men doe hold and practiſe, but muſt differ from them, it will be a trouble and griefe to his ſpirit, that he ſhould differ from them, fearing leſt God ſhould hide it from him, ſeeing others how holy and able they are, and therefore thinking they may know more of Gods minde, then he doth.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, ſuch a man will walke very humbly and reſpectively towards thoſe men, from whom he differs, being he knowes
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:117994:51"/>ſo holy and able, let us heare Mr. <hi>Burroughs</hi> ſpeake:
<note place="margin">Expoſit. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> c. 5. ver. 5. p. 395.</note> 
               <hi>But you will ſay, every man pleads conſcience; how ſhall we know whether it be the ſtoutneſſe of his heart, or the tenderneſſe of his conſcience? Thus, if this man behaveth himſelfe humbly, and the rather humbly in all other things, becauſe he cannot ſee what his Brother doth in ſuch and ſuch particulars, and ſo is in danger to be an offence to his Brother, and therefore his ſoule is humbled, this is a good witneſſe that it is meere conſcience, and not ſtoutneſſe that makes him differ: But now, if his behaviour be high, and proud, when he differeth from his brother, he doth not take it to be an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction to him, that he cannot ſee what his brother doth, but cenſureth him, and thinkes that it is either through his weakneſſe, or through his wilfulneſſe that he will not ſee, and ſo carries himſelfe high, and proudly before his brother, this witneſſeth to his face that it is ſtubbornneſſe, and ſingularity.</hi> Nay, then Mr. <hi>Burroughs,</hi> you have ſcarce left ten con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientious Separatiſts in <hi>England,</hi> the former part of this I have not ſeen in any, the latter I have ſeen enough.</p>
            <p n="6">6 A man truly conſcientious, &amp;c. in thoſe points where he doth agree with other learned and holy men, will there cleave cloſe to them, in oppoſing alſo all other points which he judgeth to be falſe; he will not be a ſlye enemy, or ſcoffer of ſuch, and a conniver at, and a favourer of other Sects and Opinions, which his heart tells him are not ſound, or at leaſt he doubts much of them.</p>
            <p>Now the grounds of all theſe ſeverall heads in the triall of him, who differs purely out of conſcience, are theſe:</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe ſuch a conſcience in the very formall notion of it carrieth this, viz. this mans heart is awed, and carried away with the Majeſty, and Authority of God and his Truth; it ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueth much grace, if one takes it in the true notion, then I am ſure ſuch a heart will doe all theſe things.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Such a man is awed with all truths,
<note place="margin">Epheſ. 4.3. Phil. 2.2. 1 Cor. 1.10</note> and therefore the command of <hi>unity,</hi> to <hi>be all of one minde,</hi> to <hi>ſpeake the ſame things;</hi> theſe have ſuch a power on his ſpirit, as it puts him upon all theſe.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Such a man conſiders that to be an offence to other godly Chriſtians, from whom he differs, is a thing that he had need take heed of; alſo a feare of weakning the worke of God in the place where he lives.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Such a one knowes the vileneſſe of his owne heart, and is prying into his own weakneſſes, others he can ſee more holy and
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:117994:52"/>able then himſelfe, and hence he feares himſelfe, and conceives ſuch men, being ſo holy and neare to God, I feare he may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veale that to them, which he conceals from me.</p>
            <p>Now then, if you can bring us men who expreſſe all theſe, and walke truly by theſe rules, you ſhall not need to goe to the <hi>State,</hi> to get an <hi>Act for Toleration of tender conſciences,</hi> for I doubt not but Churches will be very tender of ſuch; God ſeldome leaves theſe to drink in any vile errour, if for a time they be miſ-lead, he will diſcover his minde to them ere long, I am aſſured. But alas, how farre are our people from theſe things? I doe not rehearſe them over againe, but either let theſe be diſproved to be no rules to judge by, or if they be, there are not ten (as I ſaid) of ſuch ſcarce to be found in <hi>England,</hi> who ſeparate from the Miniſtry, and Churches, and have betaken themſelves to their private houſes; yea, if we goe to our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregationall Churches, and examine theſe, who plead for Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of Conſcience, we ſhall hardly finde theſe Rules ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved. The ſumme is, you ſee, if indeed you be right conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entious men, and lead by a pure Conſcience in the points wherein you differ, you ſhall have that liberty that Chriſt would have allowed you, and none will Domineere over your Conſciences.</p>
            <p>I know of nothing more can be alledged, but I thinke I have taken in all that is brought againſt the Miniſtry, and Churches. It may be, ſome would be apt to caſt in this, <hi>That the Ministers are no friends to the State,</hi> ergo, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not ſtay to give any anſwer to this more then thus:</p>
            <p n="1">1 The Separatiſts were, before this Government was erected, to be ſure the leaven of all was layed, if not all actually ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Where there are Miniſters, who are friends to the State, it is all one, for they ſeparate for all that.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Matters of State differ from the Church matters, and they were alſo very intricate and darke, eſpecially as ſome conceive, the Covenant and Proteſtation having been taken before, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in intricate things more time ſhould have been given, till you had ſeene God tying a knot upon things.</p>
            <p n="4">4 I know that many Miniſters had not hung off ſo from the State, but that they ſaw ſuch Separatiſts to be wincked at, they thought too much.</p>
            <pb n="91" facs="tcp:117994:52"/>
            <p>Obj. <hi>But you will ſay, Grant all this, that their grounds are inſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, why cannot you goe on in the worke of Reformation, ſet up Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, &amp;c. and let theſe alone? how doe theſe hinder your worke from go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on comfortably?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> If their grounds be inſufficient,
<note place="margin">Schiſme was eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med a great evill in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles times: thoſe little mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> not compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to ours, how doth the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſpeak againſt them? ſo in the Ages after, as may be ſeene in <hi>Auguſt. contra Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meni:</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Irenae</hi> ſaith, <hi>Nulla ab eis tanta fieri poteſt correptio, quanta eſt Schiſmitis pernicies, l.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 26. So our Divines of late againſt the Papiſts, to prove they were not guilty of Schiſme, have laboured ſtrongly, but outs doe but phanſie grounds, and make a tuſh at Schiſme.</note> then why doe they not come backe againe to the Churches from which they have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted? but before I give the anſwer, let theſe things be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved.</p>
            <p n="1">1 Few of theſe, who have any true good in them, but muſt and have acknowledged they have received it from the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, yea, in thoſe times, when there was much more corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the Churches then now.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Since they have left their Miniſters they have got nothing; many loſt the ſavour once they had, and ſome their comforts that were true, and ſome of theſe I know have come home a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine; generally they run out of one errour into another, that is their thriving.</p>
            <p n="3">3 I never heard of one true Convert that was ever brought home to God amongſt them all; indeed the Principles they maintaine, will not ſtand with ſound converſion; for no Law muſt be to awaken men, and ſhew them their vile condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion naturally, worke of faith is eaſie; teach no duty, but all Chriſt, [as if men could truly teach Chriſt, and no duty] theſe things ſpeake enough againſt them.</p>
            <p>But I anſwer further, If the Claſſicall and Congregationall men would but joyne together [as they may if they will] and ſet upon that worke, they might doe ſomething, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding theſe perſons, but yet they cannot comfortably hold ſo long as theſe are tolerated.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>Why, what harme have theſe done, or will they doe?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> I ſhall tell you, under ſeverall particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1 They have much weakned the hands of the Miniſtry in the worke, they were once the joy of their Miniſters, their Crown, and had they held cloſe to them ſtill, holding up their old Principles, and walking reverently, they had very much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted their hearts, and ſtrengthened their hands, now they
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:117994:53"/>came to the worke of Reformation; they could in time of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution, when Ceremonies, and ſuch traſh abounded, cleave to them, and to thoſe, who were ſilenced, they were a comfort; but now thoſe who ſhould have joyned with their Miniſters, and carried on the worke with joynt prayers, they are gone. <hi>Cyprian</hi> compares the <hi>unity</hi> of the Church,

            <p n="2">2 They are now turned the greateſt Perſecutors the Miniſters have, for <hi>tongue perſecution</hi> it is wheeled about, and reſides in this Generation: <hi>Puritans, Preciſians,</hi> were the old termes, but now the termes are, <hi>Baals-Prieſts, anti-chriſtians, Prieſts,</hi> and <hi>Black-coates</hi> are the ſobereſt termes, beſides other jeeres and ſcoffes; nay yet worſe, many of theſe would have the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters utterly rooted up [we heard of a Petition drawne up by ſome of them to be preſented to the houſe for that end] they have threatned us what they would doe, and I doubt not, if the <hi>State</hi> would give them their wills, this ſhould be their firſt vote, <hi>Down with the Miniſtry;</hi> ſo that all the old Perſecutors were not comparable to theſe, they would have ſome downe, but honour the calling, theſe would cut downe all.</p>
            <p n="3">3 They are the Nurſeries of all Errous and Hereſies; where is there one ſociety that is not tainted? who can tell how groſſe they are [though we know many groſſe enough] for they meet in private houſes, who can tell what they vent there? but if they get into Pulpits, then they will vent ſomething, and thence we may gueſſe of the reſt; ſome of them have ſpoken a gainſt the Scriptures, yet ſome againe would have the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crypha to be Canonicall; as a company of <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> ſpent the after-noon of a Lords day, to prove the <hi>Apocrypha</hi> to be ſo; the <hi>London</hi> Miniſters have ſet downe ſome bad enough in their Vindication, Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> alſo [only he ſhould not have jumb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led all Independents together, as if they did favour ſuch vile O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions, he ſhould have ſpared ſome] now if we have ſuch Nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries among our Churches, we ſhall finde it a difficult worke to keep our Churches cleare: ſome of theſe curſed ſeeds will be blowne into the Gardens.</p>
            <pb n="93" facs="tcp:117994:53"/>
            <p n="4">4 They cauſe Church-Members to walke irregularly: if any doe not walke as they ſhould, or have drunke in any poyſon, if now the Brethren firſt, and then the Officers come to deale with them, they care for no body. If they be of any number to make a Society, that they can meet together, then they will rend away, and ſo meet together; but if not ſo many (if but one) yet they know where there is a Society of Separatiſts, who wil take them in; and hence, what care they for all Officers and Churches? But have you experience of this you will ſay? Yes that I have, I could inſtance quickly in more then one Church. Hence I have heard Congregationall Miniſters ſay, it was but a vaine thing to goe about to gather a Church in a Town where the Separation was, or if it were neere, neither have they gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red any.</p>
            <p n="5">5 They doe labour to draw away the hearts of our Members from us; it hath been the language of ſome to my people, <hi>You muſt not beleeve the Black-coats.</hi> Another time preaching about familie duties, as it lay in my Catechiſe in order, one of them would needs know of one of my people, what I had to doe to preach ſuch things, I muſt teach Chriſt; ſo none ſhall finde any ſetling who attend upon Miniſters; but bleſſed be God, there be many who can tell them its falſe, and I pray God keep me from their ſetling.</p>
            <p n="6">6 They have ſpoyled many hopefull young Plants, perſons newly awakened, who have given ſome hopes; they have come in, and [like the ſpirits at <hi>London</hi>] ſtolne them away; this bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <hi>Burroughs</hi> complained of, whoſe Miniſtry in the beginning of theſe troubles worked excellently, and hoped for a fine crop, but this Generation got away thoſe young ones,
<note place="margin">Cap. 5. v. 7. p. 431.</note> as they ſaw them moved, and leavened them with their errours; thus this man loſt many of his hopefull Plants; yea, I finde ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in his Expoſition upon <hi>Hoſea,</hi> where though he doth not expreſſe his owne particular trouble concerning this [for what I mention, was his ſpeech to ſome friends, I could ſet it downe larger then I have done] yet there is the thing, I <hi>know no ſuch dreadfull argument of Gods diſpleaſure againſt this Nation</hi> [theſe are weighty words, yea, he repeates it over againe at the end of the ſame Paragraph] <hi>as this, that as ſoone as young ones begin to know Jeſus Chriſt, there are preſently corrupt errours infuſed into them, under the notion of honouring Chriſt and free grace, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="94" facs="tcp:117994:54"/>
            <p>For my owne ſelfe I am but weake, and God hath not ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured me in that kind, ſo as others of his Servants, yet I have known where I have been beſtowing paines, and have had ſome hopes, within a fortnight that an apparent change hath beene diſcerned: Some of this generation have come to draw them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way into their Societies; telling them they ſhall never bee ſettled if they attend upon Miniſters.</p>
            <p>If theſe things be ſeriouſly conſidered, you may eaſily judge how comfortably our worke will goe on, while theſe are tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated amongſt us; this is poore comfort for Miniſters to goe about Church-worke, when as if their members will prove wanton, if their officers come to deale with them, and ſend for them, they ſhall ſcorne to come at them, and ſend them baſe letters abuſing their officers (I could ſet downe in the margent where ſuch things have been acted, but I forbeare) this is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, ſo long as the Separatiſts, the enemies of the Miniſtry, are tolerated, for they can reſort to them, yea, if all the members of Congregationall Churches, as well as of Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian Churches, will ſeparate from their Officers, and goe into their private houſes, they may if they will, if they doe but meet together and exerciſe their gifts, it is ſufficient. So that though Chriſt hath appointed the ſtanding ordinance of the Miniſtry, and left the example how theſe ſhall bee orderly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, yet here is the foundation laid to deſtroy that Ordinance, and bring in nothing but confuſion; Chriſt was faithfull in his houſe as a Sonne, and ordered all things in that houſe, he hath uſed his Miniſters hitherto to bring home thoſe that he hath elected and purchaſed, he will have his houſe upon the <hi>Mountaines,</hi> but now we are come to this point not to care whether we have Ordinances or no, officers or no, what comfort then can we have in going about this work of reforming our Churches?</p>
            <p>But further if it be well obſerved, theſe people are no ſuch friends to the <hi>State,</hi> though they are looked upon as the onely friends the State hath; it will appeare if we conſider them in a <hi>morall</hi> or <hi>politicall</hi> reſpect.</p>
            <p>Firſt, for the morall reſpect, the ſtrength of a Chriſtian ſtate lies, in having Chriſt on their ſide, and I am ſure the ſtrength of our <hi>State</hi> lyes there; now is that a way to keepe Chriſt on our ſide, to tolerate thoſe who ſeeke to undermine
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:117994:54"/>that whereby he is knowne in the world? take away Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and the Miniſters who are appointed by him to diſpenſe theſe Ordinances, where ſhall we know Chriſt? but theſe la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to doe this. Can it be for their ſafety to tolerate ſuch, that hinder his viſible Kingdome from being ſet up, (at leaſt with poore comfort?) what is the reaſon that all this while there is no Diſcipline ſet up? why are we in ſuch a ſhattered broken condition? no man hath any minde to ſtirre; our ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions are not from the Drunkards, Whoremongers, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane ſwearers, &amp;c. chiefly theſe carry ſo much conviction in their owne conſciences, that they dare not much appeare; but theſe <hi>Schiſmes</hi> and <hi>Errors</hi> tolerated have been our obſtructions: If it ſhal pleaſe the State but to put forth ſome power to heal theſe (not that I would have all errors knockt down with club-law) and but ſtand to the Miniſtry, I hope we ſhall ſee the Churches of <hi>England</hi> in another poſture, and things ſo carried, that no man, who walks by a pure conſcience, ſhall be juſtly offended; for as for the Claſſicall and Congregationall Miniſters, they are come ſo near, that I beleeve there will be no difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them. Thoſe who hinder Chriſts Kingdome, cannot be true friends to a Chriſtian civill State. If any ſhall object, the <hi>State</hi> hath proſpered ſince theſe <hi>Schiſmes,</hi> and <hi>Errors</hi> have had their liberty, therefore God doth witneſſe for them: I ſhould ſay there is little Divinity in this kind of arguing, <hi>viz.</hi> to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue from Providence, to the maintaining of things croſſe to the word of God: beſides here is <hi>fallacia non cauſae pro cauſâ;</hi> For next to Gods own free &amp; ſoveraign pleaſure, which was the main cauſe, the inſtrumental cauſe of the proſpering of Army, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> muſt be referred to the many precious Saints of God, Miniſters and others, who are men reſolute for Chriſts Ordinances, and Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers; men who ſtand to their old Principles, abhorring theſe Errors and Schiſmes; who very much fearing, leaſt if the <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh</hi> party prevailed in this way, there would be little liberty for the ſound and moderate Presbyteriall men, as well as Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gationall, and therefore they lay in hard with God, by faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and Prayer, for the diſappointing of the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> deſignes: and ſurely Chriſt hath more reſpect to his owne people, who are tender of his Ordinances, Truths, and Officers, and long to ſee him ſet up in all his Ordinances before they dye, rather then to ſuch, as make light of all the former. Few of theſe Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratiſts
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:117994:55"/>trouble faſting and prayer very much, they are ſo full of joy; they caſt off thoſe fleſh-afflicting Ordinances.</p>
            <p>I would have none to miſtake me, as if I were an enemy to the Church of <hi>Scotland.</hi> No verily, I doe much honour divers of the Miniſters, and the Church of God is much bound to bleſſe God for their labours; both of former times, <hi>Rollocke</hi> &amp;c. and alſo in theſe latter daies; I conceive that man is either proud, or ignorant, or er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous, who ſhall read Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi> againſt the Jeſuits, and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minians, and doth not bleſſe God for him. Yea, the peeces that he, and Mr. <hi>Gilleſpie</hi> have writ concerning the controverſies of theſe times, for their learning, and ſweetneſſe of ſpirit in them, who can but bleſſe God for them, yea, though in ſome places croſſe to our Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gationall men? though they are condemned and ſleighted here, yet they are reverenced, and highly eſteemed amongſt the worthies in <hi>New England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yea, I adde further, I wiſh from my heart, that the Diſcipline of the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> as I finde it ſet downe in Mr. <hi>Rutherford,</hi> and others, were ſet up in <hi>England,</hi> though in ſome points a little croſſe to Congregationall principles; and yet lay all together, what I finde in Mr. <hi>Gilleſpie,</hi> I am ſo ſatisfied that I know men of moderate ſpirits in the Congregationall way, may be borne with, and live ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with them. What the practices of the people in <hi>Scotland</hi> are, I know not [I am ſure they have not worſe hearts then mine] they are not their Practices, but their ſoundneſſe in Opinion, and Diſcipline I deſire, they muſt be honoured for their purity in Worſhip, againſt humane mixtures, and for their ſoundneſſe in the faith.</p>
            <p n="2">2 In a politicall reſpect they cannot be judged true friends to the <hi>State.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This appeares, Firſt, From what we have obſerved already a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them; in that time, when the <hi>Levelling</hi> party ſtirred, how many of theſe did ſtrike in with that party, is well known here in the Country, and other great Townes, by drawing up Petitions [onely they were interrupted in their worke] ſome again ſpeaking moſt baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the Parliament, they could match the old Royaliſts in their lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage; ſuch, I ſay, as are now, and then were tolerated; and I doubt if that party moves againe, we ſhall ſee what faithfull Subjects theſe are, though now they are tolerated as friends.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The tolerating of theſe keep other men of great holineſſe, learning, and abilities from cordiall cloſing with the State; the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant to be ſure, is expreſly againſt <hi>Schiſme,</hi> and <hi>Hereſie.</hi> I have
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:117994:55"/>heard leading men ſay, if there were a good <hi>Ariſtocracy</hi> ſet up in the Nation, ſo that we might have true Patriots for the Nation; and if they would take ſome order with theſe <hi>Schiſmes,</hi> and <hi>Errors,</hi> ſo that the Ordinances and Government of Chriſt might be ſet up, indeed they could ſubmit very wel, if God ſhews it to be his mind to lay by Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy: Now it would be more honour and ſafety for a State, to have ſuch men cloſe with them, rather then ſuch as theſe are; I have heard this from ſuch, as are leading men before the <hi>Worceſter</hi> fight, which I adde becauſe it may be thought, now they would do it, now they ſee no other hopes.</p>
            <p>I ſhall wind up this Diſcourſe againſt our Separatiſts [many of which, I am ſure, have before owned the Miniſters; yea, and received Baptiſme and the Lords Supper at their hands] by propounding a few Queſtions unto them.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Queſt.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Queſtions propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Separatiſts</note> Have you any thing againſt your Miniſters in reſpect of their converſations [if they be ſcandalous in their lives, you have a way to help your ſelves] do they not walke in ſome meaſure as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh Chriſtians?</p>
            <p n="2">2 Is not their Miniſtry wholeſome? doe they not preach ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, converting, and edifying truths? though all have not the ſame gifts.</p>
            <p n="3">3 If you can charge them with either of theſe, have you with that reſpect, which becomes their places, dealt with them, and told them of ſuch faults? have you told them once and againe, yet they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to heare you, while you have patiently waited? you muſt do ſo towards a private brother, before you part, much more with a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Have you called in other Miniſters to hear the Caſe, and to judge in it? or are you only your own judges?</p>
            <p n="5">5 Doe they mixe any thing in the Worſhip of God, ſo as you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not joyn with them in the worſhip without ſinne? and have you dealt with them as before?</p>
            <p n="6">6 If there be ſome thing which you would have received or done, have you given them convincing Arguments to prove it ought to be?</p>
            <p n="7">7 Was the thing you deſired <hi>Tanti,</hi> of ſo great conſideration, that the word wil clearly bear you out for ſeparating, becauſe you could not enjoy what you would have?</p>
            <p n="8">8 Might not meekneſſe of ſpirit waiting a while have won your Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters to a yeelding in ſome degree to what you deſired?</p>

<note place="margin">This w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

            <p>I ſhall ſay no more but this, though ſome of theſe Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts are godly men, yet if godly men ſtand thus as now we do, I beleeve God will not ſpare us, though we be godly men, but he will ere long bring ſuch plagues upon the <hi>profeſsing</hi> party in <hi>England,</hi> as ſhall make their hearts ake. For my part, I look on <hi>England</hi> thus, there have been choice ſervants of God in <hi>England,</hi> who laboured under the Hierarchicall oppreſſion, many ſtrong cryes have they made for the removall of that burden, and that they might enjoy him in his owne Ordinances, without the mixtures of mens inventions; God hath given us in the anſwer of thoſe prayers, as to the removing of what offended: and now ſaith God, looke you to it, yee Profeſſors, I give the power (which never your Fathers ſaw) into the hands of the Puritanicall

            <p>Having done with the Separatiſts, I ſhall now take a ſhort view of the agreements and differences that are with, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Claſſical and Congregational Divines, and then
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:117994:57"/>ſhall make bold to preſent an humble requeſt to the Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Divines.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Do the Claſſical-brethren ſtand for all the Ordinances of Chriſt, as Praying, Preaching, Sacraments, Diſcipline, &amp;c? ſo doe the Congregational-brethren.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Do the Claſſical-brethren ſtand for Chriſts officers, <hi>Paſtors, ſach ers, Ruling-elders, Deacons,</hi> allowing ſuch, and onely ſuch? o doe the Congregational-brethren. They agree in worſhip and in officers.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Do the Claſsical-brethren hold to the old doctrines of Faith, Repentanee, holding up the preaching of the Law in its method, to prepare before faith, to guide after faith? ſo do the Congregational-brethren, ſuch as we looke upon as ſound, and eſteem worth the regarding.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Do the Claſsical-brethren hold the government of the Church to be <hi>Presbyterial?</hi> ſo do the Congregational-men, ſuch as are the moſt acute. Beſides what Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> (none of the loweſt ranke) hath aſſerted in his book which I quoted before, I have heard him ſay, <hi>That if the Congregational-government did make the government of the Church democratical, he would give up the cauſe.</hi>

            <p>For my part, I am but among the weakeſt of Gods Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, but yet I thinke it were no hard matter to prove the government of the Church to be <hi>Ariſtocratical:</hi> I enter not now into the debating of the queſtion, but this hath much ſtucke with me.</p>
            <p>Firſt, there is government in the Church, I meane an exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall politie, beſides an internall government of the Spirit, what ever our phantaſtical Spiritualiſts have dreamed of; the Scripture is too plain againſt theſe.</p>
            <p>Secondly, then there are <hi>governours</hi> and <hi>governed;</hi> this muſt needs be yeelded, elſe <hi>government</hi> cannot be; for <hi>governours</hi> there are, none that are ſound in their wits can deny, if they owne the Scriptures.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the affaires then of the Church muſt be ſo carried, that theſe Relates may be kept diſtinct: for that government which deſtroys theſe, by making the <hi>Correlate, i.</hi> the <hi>body governed,</hi> to be <hi>governour</hi> (and ſo there are none governed) cannot poſsibly be, a government ſtanding ſo much with the light of nature.

            <pb n="101" facs="tcp:117994:57"/>
            <p>Obj. <hi>But how can the government of the Church be Ariſtocraticall, when as you carry things by the ſuffrage of the people?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I ſhould deſire alſo to propound theſe queſtions.</p>
            <p>Firſt, would you not, if now Churches were conſtituting, give the people this liberty, that if any could bring in good teſtimony againſt a man, who was to bee received into the Church, that they ſhould do it, and if the thing be proved, will not you refuſe to admit ſuch a one?</p>
            <p>Secondly, if it now come to caſting out of a member, will not you give liberty to any of the brethren, who ſhall (firſt asking you leave to ſpeak) in a ſober, grave way, propound ſome que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion to the clearing of the caſe in hand, before the people joyn with you in cutting off a member, I ſay, would not you give this liberty?</p>
            <p>Thirdly, will you excommunicate <hi>renitente eccleſiâ?</hi> your books ſay otherwiſe, and you know what both our Ancient and Moderne Divines have affirmed in this point, and therefore I quote none.</p>
            <p>I do not mention election to be given to the people, for that hath nothing of government in it, and this you give fully; but if you grant me the three former heads, then which way you will prove the government to be <hi>Ariſtocraticall,</hi> the ſame way I ſhall. I have ſpoken to this before, and therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude with <hi>Chamies,</hi> and others, the government is <hi>Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craticall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Obj. <hi>But how can this be, if the people will not conſent, how are they governed?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Put caſe <hi>Jonathan</hi> had been indeed a great malefactor, and <hi>Saul</hi> would have had him legally and juſtly put to death, but the people would not conſent to their King, but reſcue <hi>Jonathan,</hi> ſhall we hence conclude, <hi>ergo</hi> the government of <hi>Iſrael</hi> is not <hi>Monarchicall?</hi> the caſe is the ſame here.</p>
            <p>Now I am upon this head, I ſhall deſire to make a little di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſsion, before I proceed to any more heads. Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> in a Sermon at <hi>Colcheſter</hi> laid down this <hi>Theſis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>That there was no ſuch tyrannicall government in any Church (unleſſe it were in the Church of Rome) as is in the Independent Churches;</hi> he proved it thus, <hi>They carry all things by the ſuffrage of the people, and if all doe not conſent, they will cenſure them;</hi> how he will prove this? a <hi>ſpeciall example, in the Church of</hi> Boſton <hi>in</hi> New England, <hi>when
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:117994:58"/>they excommunicated</hi> Mrs. Hutchiſon; <hi>becauſe her owne ſonne did not joyne in the caſting out of his owne mother, he was likewiſe cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured;</hi> an unnaturall thing, ſaid he, and ſo carried it, that both his owne friends, and other Miniſters, who were ſtrangers, thought he was alſo excommunicated, as they told me when I ſpake with them.</p>
            <p>The ſtory doth ſomething concerne the head I am upon, and therefore I make bold to inſert it here. I was a little troubled at the paſſage, knowing well how things were carried, being preſent at that time, and ſo tooke occaſion ſome few weeks after, to give a bare narrative how the thing was carried with ſo much meekneſſe, I am ſure as none could accuſe me. The ſumme is this, When all wayes according to the word had beene tryed with Mrs. <hi>Hutchiſon</hi> to recall her, but none would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile, the queſtion was put to the Church to manifeſt conſent for her excommunication; her ſonne and ſonne-in-law (one more then Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> mentioned) ſtood up to put ſome ſtop in the way (had they ſate ſtill, as any body would have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, though they had ſuſpended their votes, I know not who would have ſpoken one word to them) Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> roſe up, and gave them a grave admonition, that though their naturall affection might now worke, for which hee did not blame them, yet he would not have them preferre their mother be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſt, nor hinder their mother from that Ordinance, which might bee a meanes to ſave her ſoule; with theſe words they both ſate downe: they never had any other cenſure (if this be a cenſure) and the Church proceeded in her excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication. Now I appeale unto all, to judge where was the tyranny in this act? yet though I carried this with all mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, this was the onely cauſe why Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> raked up all he could againſt me, and put it into print, even ſuch things as never were in my thoughts. But here you may ſee, they ſtand not upon the ſuffrage of all the people.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, doe the Claſſical-men call for Synods? ſo do the Congregational-men, Mr. <hi>Cotton,</hi> Keyes c. 6. Mr. <hi>Norton, Reſpon. ad Apollon.</hi> p. 112. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And certainly they are men of ſtrange ſpirits, who deny Synods to be uſefull, and no Ordinance of God: I doubt he did not well conſider what his pen let drop, and left it to po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity, <hi>That he never ſaw any good that came by any Synod, but rather
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:117994:58"/>the contrary.</hi> A great Clerke indeed he was, but ſurely the man was in ſome paſſion; I am ſure I have knowne the contrary, much good come by Synods; but ſome of our Independents ſnutch up this ſentence of his, as if it were Apoſtolical. This is the difference, ſay the <hi>Congregational-men,</hi> the Synod bindes <hi>directivè, non juridicè,</hi> the <hi>Claſsical</hi> will have both.</p>
            <p>When I obſerve what both ſides ſpeak of Synods, methinks this can be no ſuch matter of difference.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Claſsical</hi> Brethren ſay,
<note place="margin">Lond. Vind. p. 23</note> 
               <hi>All the determinations even of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall Synods are to be obeyed no further, then they agree with the word of God; and</hi> that a Synod <hi>eſt judex judicandus; That Congregations are to examine with the judgment of diſcretion, what is ſent to them from Synods.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi> ſaith,

               <hi>The Acts of the Aſſembly oblige all the abſents, not preſent in all their members, not becauſe of the Authority of the Church, but becauſe of the matter, which is neceſſary and agreeable to Gods word.</hi>

               <hi>That people may not examine decrees of their Synods according to Gods word: That people may not reaſon or ſpeake in their Synods,

            <p>Mr. <hi>Gilleſpie</hi> ſtates a queſtion; <q>Suppoſe a ſcandalous perſon would come to the Sacrament,
<note place="margin">Aar. rod. 477, 478.</note> the Miniſter knowing him to be ſo, adviſeth the Elderſhip to joyne with him, and do their duty in keeping this perſon away, it may be they refuſe; Appeale is made to higher Aſſemblies, Claſſis, Synod, &amp;c. they it may be will judge him fit for the Sacrament, this is their ſentence, muſt this Miniſter now obey the ſentence of the Claſsis or Synod? His determination is, That the Miniſter being cleare in his conſcience, and the matter of ſcandal ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently proved, he muſt not doe an unlawfull act in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to men, but follow the rule, 1 Tim. 5.22. <hi>Keep thy ſelfe pure,</hi> his conſcience illuminated by Gods word is a rule to him of his owne perſonal acting, or not acting.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Come to the <hi>Congregational-men,</hi> Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> ſaith,
<note place="margin">Keys p. 25</note> 
               <hi>We dare not
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:117994:59"/>ſay that the power of a Synod reaches no further then the giving connſell, they bind burthens, they bind not onely materially, but formally, from the Authority of the Synod,</hi> See more, p. 53, 54.</p>
            <p>Neither doe I ſee, that our reverend Divines in their preface to that book do oppoſe Mr. <hi>Cotton;</hi> for ſay they [in laying down Mr. <hi>Cottons</hi> judgement] <hi>Chriſt hath not furniſhed them only with ability to give Counſell, but with a Miniſteriall power and Authority, to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, declare, and injoyn ſuch things, as may tend to reducing ſuch Congregations to right order and peace.</hi> But is there Authority? it may be my ſhallowneſſe; but for the preſent I doe not call to mind any power inveſted with Authority, but if they injoyne a thing to bee done, and it be refuſed, that Authority will reach further. <hi>Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas cogit,</hi> as is the kind of the Authority, Civill or Eccleſiaſticall.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Bleſſed <hi>Burroughs</hi> [in anſwering to that which ſome would have,
<note place="margin">Iren. p. 44.</note> 
                  <hi>ſcil,</hi> that a Synod may formally excommunicate, becauſe by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication, they (<hi>i.e.</hi> Hereticall Churches) are put out of the Kingdome of Chriſt, into the Kingdome of Satan, and this will ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie] ſaith, conſider whether this be not done before, and that with an authority of Chriſt, by thoſe former ſix things (mentioned in the page before) for Hereticall Congregations, or perſons are judged, and declared in a ſolemn Ordinance, by the Officers of Chriſt gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together in his name, to be ſuch as have no right to any Church Ordinance, to have no Communion with any of the Churches of Chriſt; now if this judgement be right, are not ſuch perſons or Congregations put out of the Kingdome of Chriſt, and put under the power of Satan, conſequently?</q>
            </p>
            <p>Certainly, this cannot be a ground of ſuch difference, ſhall <hi>Non</hi> and <hi>Ex</hi> make ſuch a ſtir, when <hi>Non</hi> is as bad as <hi>Ex?</hi> I ſhould judge my ſelf, I am ſure, to be in as bad a caſe by the one, as the other, though for my part this notion of Catholike-viſible-Church, hath made me ready to yeeld to Synods juridicall power; I could I ſay yeeld it, and yet not differ from theſe reverend Divines, if they follow home their non-communion cloſe.</p>
            <p>Now if you ſay, what doth this helpe againſt Hereticall Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, though you have proceeded to Non-communion, they regard it not, but ſtill go on in their Hereſies, and leaven others? to that they wil ſay, what do they care for your excommunication, if all the Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks in <hi>England</hi> were excommunicated, they would not care, but go on ſtill. Indeed our <hi>New England</hi> Divines will teach us a way how to helpe it, <hi>viz.</hi> if a Synod hath declared againſt an Hereticall Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:117994:59"/>being pertinacious, and ſo hath proceeded to non-communion, they will call in the Civil power to help, and ſo they have a way to help by their non-communion, and this muſt be the help of them though they be excommunicated.</p>

As alſo Mr. <hi>Burroughs.</hi> And thus it was in <hi>New England;</hi> when the Synod (at which the Civill Power was preſent, as to hear, ſo to keep civill order) had conſuted and condemned the Errors and Hereſies, and ſo was broke up, then a Generall Court was called, which ſoon ſuppreſſed thoſe Hereſies, and brought the Churches to peace again.</p>
            <p>If the Civill power would do as much here, we ſhould ſoon ſee our Churches in better order. What Civill Magiſtrates have done in this eaſe before, I need not mention, books are full. Its true, the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches were, when there was no Civill Power to defend them, but oppoſe them; but we can finde how many Hereſies and Schiſmes they were then troubled with; ſhall the Church be in no better caſe under a Chriſtian Civill Power, Nurſing-Fathers, then at that time?</p>
            <p n="6">6 Doe the <hi>Claſſicall</hi> godly men looke upon their Congregations, having viſible Saints among them, to be true <hi>viſible Churches?</hi> ſo doe the <hi>Congregationall</hi> men judge them alſo. I gave inſtance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
            <p n="7">7 Would then the <hi>Claſſical</hi> brethren, have their members (being ſuch as have right to the Ordinance) to partake with Congregational Churches in the Lords Supper to ſhew their communion? certainly ſo they <hi>ought;</hi> but why Congegationall men doe refuſe godly men, members of <hi>Claſſicall</hi> Churches, not admitting them to the Lords Supper, when they have deſired it, is very ſtrange to me; I wiſh our reverend Brethren would give us ſolid grounds for this practice, for it gives offence, and that juſtly.
<note n="a" place="margin">Preface to ſurvey ch. diſ.</note> Mr. <hi>Hooker,</hi> and
<note n="b" place="margin">Iren. p. 266.</note> Mr. <hi>Burroughs</hi> have both ſaid they ſhould be admitted: Shal a Church be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to be a true Church, where Doctrine and Worſhip is pure al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, this perſon a member of it, a viſible Saint (it may be a real Saint) and ſhall he be denyed communion?</p>
            <p n="8">8 For <hi>Claſſes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pref. ſurv. ch. diſ.</note> the <hi>Congregationall</hi> men ſay <hi>Conſociation of Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches is not onely lawfull, but in ſome caſes neceſſary.</hi> So Mr. <hi>Hooker.</hi>
               <pb n="106" facs="tcp:117994:60"/>Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> ſpeakes fully to this, Keyes p. 54, 55. weighty mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ſuch as, <hi>Election and ordination of Elders, excommunication of an Elder, or any perſon of publike note, the tranſlation of an Elder from one</hi> Church to another, it is an holy Ordinance to proceed with common conſultation and conſent. I ſuppoſe thus much might have beene obtained of the Claſſical-brethren, that though in caſes of weight, as excommunication, they would not have ſuch an Ordinance carried on by one Miniſter, but have the thing ſeriouſly examined firſt, and debated in a Claſſis, yet when the thing had beene concluded upon, they would leave the execution of the ſentence to the officer, or officers of the Church, where the caſe lyeth. If ſo much might be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, I ſhould be very farre from oppoſing a <hi>Claſsis,</hi> I would not willingly live without one.</p>
            <p>I know of no other material point of difference, as for the <hi>firſt ſubject</hi> of the power of the Keyes, that is but a notion, though its true, much practiſe depends upon it, yet I finde not that our Divines here would have the <hi>fraternity</hi> to be the <hi>firſt ſubject,</hi> by their owning of Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> his booke of the <hi>Keyes;</hi> for Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> makes a <hi>Church organized</hi> to bee the <hi>firſt ſubject,</hi> and not the Fraternity, as is apparent in divers places of that booke.</p>
            <p>The ſumme is, I wonder at our differnces, well might that worthy Divine ſay in his letter to me from <hi>New England, Its the wonderment of this ſide of the world, that you that are godly, and may agree, yet will not!</hi> ſurely the cauſe lyeth more in the <hi>Will,</hi> then any thing elſe. Give me leave therefore I pray, to make my humble requeſt to our Reverend Divines, the <hi>Congregational-men,</hi> that they would pleaſe to cloſe in with the <hi>Claſſical</hi> brethren, and not ſuffer theſe groundleſſe differences to trouble the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches any longer. If you aske, <hi>Why doe you make your requeſt to us, are we the cauſe why they are not bealed?</hi> I cannot thinke the cauſe lyes onely in the Miniſters; nay I have heard long ſince there had been an agreement among the Miniſters, had not ſome others that live by diviſions, broken it; but whether all Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters are of the ſame minde I know not: nay, I have obſerved the ſpirits of ſome <hi>Congregational-Miniſters</hi> carried with more eagerneſſe againſt the <hi>Claſsical-brethren,</hi> then <hi>è converſo,</hi> and I am ſure, if there be any blame among the Miniſters, it is charged moſt upon the <hi>Congregational-men,</hi> whether juſtly or no, it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:117994:60"/>you to cleare your ſelves: Beſides, at this time the Civill power moſt ſmiles upon you, and now it is a good time to ſhew you ſeeke the peace and flouriſhing of all Churches, by joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with your fellow-brethren, and not to be content though your <hi>Interest</hi> be ſafe, unleſſe the whole may have comfort as well as your ſelves; for you cannot but judge that there are more true viſible Churches, then thoſe which are called Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent Churches, and that there be others that are true Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, beſides the Independent Miniſters; why then ſhould not the comfort of theſe Churches and Miniſters be ſought? which cannot be, unleſſe your ſelves be pleaſed to declare againſt theſe errours and ſchiſmes of the times, and fall in with theſe Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters to carry on the worke of Chriſt together. Let mee, I beſeech you, preſent to your view a few things to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered.</p>
            <p>Firſt, the <hi>Claſſical men</hi> have bid very faire for peace and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with you; heare their words,
<note place="margin">Lond. in Vind. p. 120. 121.</note> 
               <hi>We doe here manifeſt our wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſſe te accommodate with you according to the word in a way of union; and (ſuch of us as are Miniſters) to preach up and to practiſe a mutuall forbearance and toleration in all things, that may conſiſt with the ſunda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals of Religion</hi> [what need then any other Toleration?] <hi>with the power of godlineſſe, and with that peace, which Chriſt hath eſtabliſhed in his Church; but to make ruptures in the body of Chriſt, and to divide Church from Church, &amp;c. there is no warrant for this out of the word.</hi> The page before this, they offer as much as this, and ſpeake ſo Chriſtianly and ingenuouſly, that it muſt needs move any Chriſtian heart that loves the peace and proſperity of the Churches, to meet them halfe way, and not ſuffer any diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences more to appeare.</p>
            <p>As for that exception they make, <hi>the ruptures of Churches,</hi> I thinke it to be a very juſt exception; that golden rule hath place here, <hi>ut tibi, ſic aliis,</hi> would any of us be content to have other Miniſters take from us the beſt of our people that have choſen us before, and owned us for their officers? ſay what you pleaſe, you are <hi>men,</hi> and I know it would be a ſtrong temptation, when as for want of theſe, alſo their hands are weakned in the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying on of Reformation in their Churches.</p>
            <p>If you take away the beſt (who are the joy of a Miniſter) take away the worſt alſo. If you live neare a place where there is no Miniſter, and take in ſuch Chriſtians to you as the place affords,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:117994:61"/>and returne them when the place is furniſhed: or if there be a Miniſter, and but few Chriſtians, ſo that he cannot give the Lords Supper with comfort, if he and his people will joyne with you they may, none oppoſe this; but when a godly Miniſter hath viſible Saints ſufficient in his Pariſh, to have theſe taken from him, is ſuch a thing which I would not have offered to me, therefore I would not offer the ſame to another. I know where the pinch lyes, on the Miniſters part, <hi>Our maintenance ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth from the members, &amp;c.</hi> but for this the State hath provided an anſwer (and certainly it is a great mercy) reforme you in the place where you live, take none but Scriputre-viſible-Saints to the Sacraments, catechize, and doe what you can to reforme the reſt, the State hath provided for your maintenance, none ſhall keepe it from you, as well as the word gives it you, Gal. 6. <hi>Let him that is taught in the word communicate to him that teacheth in all good things. Chriſt ſent Paul not to baptize, but to preach the Goſpel,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.17. preaching is the ſpending worke, and the chiefe, of this all the Pariſh are partakers, I am ready to diſpenſe the Seales to all viſible Saints, therefore I know no ſcruple why I ſhould not receive from all, ſince all receive from me.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>O but your members will not be content with this.</hi> I know not but your members may finde God in a godly reformed Claſsicall Church, we ſee the differences are very ſmall; but ſuppoſe the worſt, let then your members remove into the Pariſhes where you live, and this is no offence to any; if they ſay, <hi>It will ſomething hinder their eſtate:</hi> Mr. <hi>Burroughs</hi> wil tel them then they love their bodies better then their ſoules,
<note place="margin">Expoſ. Hoſ. c. 2. v. 1.2. p. 225.</note> if they looke upon things very much concerning their ſoul, and will not buy them with ſome abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their profit: could this have beene once enjoyed, <hi>New England</hi> ſufferers had not been there now; Though Pariſhes are not Churches, yet Miniſters care muſt be bounded ſome where. I preſume you are willing to cloſe, ſo that you may not ſin.</p>
            <p>I beſeech you firſt, what ſinne is it to let a godly Claſsicall man enjoy his owne members?</p>
            <p>Secondly, What ſinne is it to admit a viſible Saint, and member of a Claſsical Church to communion with you?</p>
            <p>Thirdly, what ſinne is it to declare againſt the errours and ſchiſmes of the times? you ſee it is the thoughts of the <hi>New England</hi> Divines, that through our too much connivence at theſe, this inundation of errours is like to deſtroy all. If theſe
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:117994:61"/>three be but yeelded, I beleeve you may live and enjoy your liberty of conſcience, and no man will trouble you.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A ſecond conſideration is this, you ſee thoſe who call for agreement, they are no babes, they are men, holy, learned, excellently gifted, and the arguments they give for their <hi>Claſsical</hi> forme of government are not ſlight, but ſuch as deſerve ſtrong heads to anſwer; it may be my ſhallowneſſe, but truly I cannot yet ſee ſome things they plead for to be clearly anſwered, as their arguments for the <hi>Catholick-Church-viſible;</hi> their arguments for their Presbyterial Church, from the Church of <hi>Jeruſalem, Corinth,</hi> &amp;c. yet I have read the anſwers with a kinde of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice againſt the <hi>Claſsical</hi> way, being before engaged in the <hi>Congregational-way,</hi> and uſually then men are apt to make a little ſerve the turne: But I cannot yet be ſatisfied, and that ſuch a Church as is in this ſmall village where I live, ſhould have equall power with the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> and be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted from all other power, though (which God forbid) we ſhould walke ſcandalouſly, is a peece of Divinity that I cannot yet beleeve. There ſeemes to be ſomething in that which learned Mr. <hi>Hudſon</hi> hinteth from 1 Cor. 14.34. <hi>Let your women keepe ſilence in the Churches.</hi> Here are <hi>Churches</hi> in <hi>Corinth,</hi> he doth not ſay, <hi>Let women,</hi> but <hi>Let your women</hi> (that indeed which is a rule for the Churches of <hi>Corinth,</hi> is a rule for all Churches) thoſe Congregations are called <hi>Churches,</hi> yet one combined Church of <hi>Corinth.</hi>

            <p>There are other points beſides which I mention not, but cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the controverſie is not ſo clear as the controverſie againſt <hi>Papiſts, Socinians,</hi> &amp;c. therefore I ſhould thinke that we had need cloſe the more with theſe men.</p>
            <p>A third conſideration is this; unto me it is ſomething, I know not how it takes with others, the ſtrange things that God in his Providence hath ſuffered to fall out in <hi>Congregatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall</hi> Churches, I meane for Diviſions eſpecially, and errours; that charge cannot bee denied of many Congregationall Members what errours they have drunke in; and for <hi>Diviſions,</hi> they are not ſecret things, but ſuch as the whole Nation knows, inſomuch that I have heard a ſerious Congregationall Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and an able man ſay, when he hath heard what crackes, and rendings there have been in <hi>Congregationall</hi> Churches, he thought ſeriouſly whether it were the way of God or no; how
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:117994:62"/>many Congregationall Churches may be reckoned where theſe have been, and if Miniſters doe not let their Members take their owne courſe, even what they will, and drinke in what errours they will, it is hard to keep a Church from ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ius Divi.</hi> p. 114 that learned Book.</note> 
               <hi>England</hi> gives ſtrong proofe of this. It is a very unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Story that Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> relates of the Church at <hi>Arnheim,</hi> if it be true, I finde it quoted by the <hi>London</hi> Miniſters: where that Act was done in <hi>New England,</hi> that Mr. <hi>Cawdrey</hi> mentions in his Epiſtle to the diſſenting Brethren, I cannot imagine; but that is alſo ſtrange, if true; I ſuppoſe he relates as it was related to him, I know indeed where there is a ſad example of this kinde there alſo. This uſe I make of theſe things, that we had need take another review of Congregationall principles, in reſpect of that power which is given to the Fraternity, and in the meane time to be very tender towards the <hi>Claſſicall</hi> Brethren, and ſtudy agreement with them.</p>
            <p>The fourth, The <hi>Claſſicall</hi> men are oppoſed in reforming their Churches, as well as the <hi>Congregationall</hi> men; now for theſe to be oppoſed, not only by the prophane part, whom they keep off from the Lords Snpper, but to be oppoſed alſo by the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregationall</hi> men, that they prove a griefe to them, this is a hard chapter; certainly we had need more cloſe with them, and help to comfort them, rather then grieve them in their worke, they are ſcorned by the profane party, let not us ſcorne them.</p>
            <p n="5">5 Theſe Nurſeries of errours [I meane the Separatiſts, who caſt off Orthodox Officers] are as bad enemies to the <hi>Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall</hi> Churches, as they are to the <hi>Claſſicall;</hi> nay worſer, your Members will quickly drinke in their poyſon, yea, and goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from you to them,
<note place="margin">Pag. 119.</note> as experience hath teſtified; therefore it concernes you to joyne with the <hi>Claſsicall</hi> men againſt them; but by one paſſage I meet with in the <hi>London Vindication,</hi> it ſeems ſome <hi>Congregationall</hi> men doe not thinke ſo, for they in their complaint to you thus ſpeake; <hi>Are there not ſome of you that chuſe rather to joyne with Anabaptiſts, and Epiſcopall men then with us? and that will give letters dimiſſory to your Members, to depart from you to the Churches of the Anabaptiſts? and at the ſame time deny them to ſuch as deſire them, for to joyne with Churches of our Communion? we charge not theſe things upon you all, but upon ſome, whoſe names we forbeare to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> this is very ſtrange, but this confirmes what I ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that the cauſe of our diſ-union is not altogether in the <hi>Claſsicall</hi> men.</p>

            <p n="6">6 I pray conſider what a fine Game the Devill hath played by this oppoſition between us, hath he not turned our Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation into a deformation? Hath he not cauſed the building of the Temple to ceaſe? Doe not all things that concerne the Reformation of the Church ſtand at a ſtay? What doe we now? indeed thoſe who are for Congregationall Government, have the opportunity to gather Churches [as they call it] but what becomes of the whole? It was told me when I was in <hi>Spaine,</hi> [which was the winter before <hi>Naſeby</hi> Fight] that divers that were in religious Orders that lived there, were got into <hi>England;</hi> Certainly Jeſuits, or Devils have been here to hold the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gationall, and Claſſicall Brethren at ſuch a diſtance, that while they have been contending about Government, we are in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of looſing Ordinances, Truths, Government, and be ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up with a deluge of Errors, Schiſmes, and Hereſies; <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide &amp; impera,</hi> that hath been Satans project.</p>
            <p n="7">7 I beſeech you conſider, whether we lye not open to Gods ſtroke: is there not matter of provocation given him, by reaſon of theſe Diviſions (that his worke ſtands at a ſtay) Errours, Schiſmes, Hereſies, and decay of godlineſſe that follows upon theſe, that he ſhould take away the Liberties he hath given us, and make us feele a heavie yoke againe? Surely theſe things will not be long borne. Mr. <hi>Caryll</hi> hath a ſad ſpeech,

               <hi>God hath begun to doe ſo many marvells amongſt us, that I verily beleeve the worke he is about, will end in a marvell too; and we in the cloſe ſhall be made ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a wonder of Mercy, or a wonder of Judgement to all the Nations round about.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We are made indeed a <hi>wonder</hi> in regard of the ſtrange Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Hereſies, Diviſions, they wonder at us in <hi>New England;</hi> but till God ſets up his Kingdome in our hearts,
